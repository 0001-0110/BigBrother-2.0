I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth;
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered
under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried.
He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;
He ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of God the Father
Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of
Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.
