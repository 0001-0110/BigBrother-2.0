Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy,
our life, our sweetness, and our hope.
To you do we cry, poor banished children of Eve;
to you do we send up our sighs,
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
Turn, then, most gracious advocate,
your eyes of mercy toward us;
and after this our exile show us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus:
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
