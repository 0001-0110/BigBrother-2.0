My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong
and failing to do good, I have sinned against you whom I should love
above all things. I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no
more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.
Our Savior, Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.
In his name, my God, have mercy. Amen
