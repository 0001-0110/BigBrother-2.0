The clock stopped ticking
Forever ago
How long have I been up?
I don't know
I can't get a grip, but I can't let go
There wasn't anything to hold onto, though
Why can't I see
Why can't I see
All the colours
That you see?
Please, can I be
Please, can I be
Colourful and free?
What the hell's going on?
Can someone tell me, please
Why I'm switching faster than the channels on TV?
I'm black, then I'm white
No, something isn't right
My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight
The trembling fear
Is more than I can take
When I'm up against
The echo in the mirror
Echo
I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black
I'm gonna run away now and never look back
I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black
I'm gonna run away now and never look back
I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black
I'm gonna run away now and never look back
I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black
I'm gonna run away now and never look back
I'm gonna burn my house down and never look back (and never look back)
And never look back (and never look back)
And never look back
What the hell's going on?
Can someone tell me, please
Why I'm switching faster than the channels on TV?
I'm black, then I'm white
No, something isn't right
My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight
What the hell's going on?
Can someone tell me, please
Why I'm switching faster than the channels on TV?
I'm black, then I'm white
No, something isn't right
My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight
The trembling fear
Is more than I can take
When I'm up against
The echo in the mirror
The trembling fear
Is more than I can take
When I'm up against
The echo in the mirror
