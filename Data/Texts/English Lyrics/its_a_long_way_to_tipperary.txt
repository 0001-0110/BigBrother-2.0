Up to mighty London came
An Irish man one day
All the streets were paved with gold
So everyone was gay!
Singing songs of Piccadilly
Strand, and Leicester Square
'Til Paddy got excited and
He shouted to them there:
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye Piccadilly
Farewell Leicester Square!
It's a long long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there.
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye Piccadilly
Farewell Leicester Square!
It's a long long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there.
Paddy wrote a letter
To his Irish Molly O'
Saying, "Should you not receive it
Write and let me know!
If I make mistakes in "spelling"
Molly dear", said he
"Remember it's the pen, that's bad
Don't lay the blame on me".
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye Piccadilly
Farewell Leicester Square
It's a long long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there.
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye Piccadilly
Farewell Leicester Square
It's a long long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there.
