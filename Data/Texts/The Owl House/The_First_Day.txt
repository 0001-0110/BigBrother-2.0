[Open on a dark backstage. Luz activates a light glyph and holds it between her and Eda.]
Luz: I-I'm not ready for this Eda. Maybe we should go back.
Eda: Nah kid, you got this, just do what we practiced!
Luz: But what if... What if I mess something up? Or what if I do something wrong? [gasps] What if I die?
Eda: Hey. Calm down, calm down. I had to do the same thing when I was a witchling. It's like a rite of passage. Granted, I was a little more skilled.
Luz: Eda!
Eda: Right, right. Sorry, sorry. Now, get pumped.
Luz: Pumped!
Eda: Get ready.
Luz: [pulls hood up] Ready!
Eda: Now, go! [shoves her]
[Cut to the stage, a spotlight aimed at the closed curtains and a banner reading "Hexside School: Entrance Exams." The curtains open. Luz jumps on stage in a dark cloak.]
Luz: [movie trailer narrator voice] From the humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise. [normal voice] I have traveled from another realm and trained with a powerful witch to master dark and forbidden magic. I am... [takes cloak off with a twirl] Luz Noceda!
[Reveal the audience, which is empty except for Principal Bump sitting in the front row with a clipboard.]
Luz: [chuckles awkwardly, tosses confetti out of a fanny pack] Confetti!
Principal Bump: Right. The human that wants to be a witch. Against my better judgement, I've allowed you to take this exam into Hexside. But can you even do magic with all your... human parts?
Luz: I sure can. [zips open fanny pack] It's said that humans can't do magic, [pulls out papers and shows them to both sides of the auditorium] but I discovered a lost technique that changes everything.
Principal Bump: Hmm?
[Eda gives two thumbs-up from backstage. Luz activates the light glyph and lets the ball rise. She moves the ice glyph under the light and activates it. Luz beams and does jazz hands.]
Principal Bump: Spells cast with paper? I've never heard of such a thing. [to himself] But is it enough to pass the exam?
Luz: Uhh...
Eda: Improvise.
Luz: Um, I can do other things, what about... this? [stands, flips eyelids inside out] Bleep, bloop, bleep!
[Principal Bump is not impressed.]
Luz: Ow ow! Eyelash! Eyelash!
[Luz slips on the melted ice pillar and falls into her abandoned cloak. She stands and tries to free herself, falling off the stage and onto Principal Bump. She rolls off him.]
Luz: Sorry, sorry, sorry! [places hand on an ice glyph] Whoops! AH!
[The ice pillar lifts her up by one foot until she's eye level with Principal Bump.]
Luz: I failed, didn't I?
Principal Bump: Believe it or not, I've seen worse.
Luz: [falls on her face]
Principal Bump: Welcome, Luz, to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics! [drops pamphlet on her head]
Luz: [weakly] Hurray.
-THEME SONG-
[Cut to Eda and Luz flying on Eda's staff. Luz is wearing a Hexside uniform, though the normal uniform part is lighter than most and her sleeves and leggings are very light gray.]
Luz: Mmm, we gotta go back. This was a mistake! I'm gonna mess things up again and everyone will see, and-
Eda: Right, you gotta calm down. What are you nervous about? You've been to school before.
Luz: That's why I'm nervous! At my human school, I didn't make a good first impression. This is a chance to be seen as something other than a screw-up.
Eda: Hey, don't worry about what those dorks think. If you want my advice, walk into class and punch the first kid you see. To establish dominance.
Luz: Aw, I won't be doing that. But thanks.
[They land at Hexside. Luz dismounts.]
Eda: Last chance to back out, and earn a new Bad Girl Coven patch. [holds up a patch that reads "Quitter Badge"] Quitting: It's like trying, but easier.
Luz: Nah, I'll just earn it when I quit showering. Bye! [runs off]
Eda: Hold up! [throws hand at Luz's head to turn her around] Just try not to be too much of a goody Luz shoes. [screws hand back on] You got this.
Luz: Thanks, Eda. In fact, [pulls sock puppets of her and Eda out of her pockets] I have written a heartfelt sonnet to commemorate this occasion.
Eda: [flying away] Whoops! A gust of wind just got me. See you after school! Byeeee!
Luz holding Puppet Eda: You're gonna do great, kid.
Luz: Thanks, Puppet Eda.
[Cut to a banner reading "WELCOME TO THE NEW SEMESTER". Various students are arriving at Hexside. Luz looks around with a smile on her face. Amity and an abomination come up to her.]
Amity: [her abomination mirroring her movements] Hey, Luz! Congrats on getting in. And not being in the baby class.
Luz: Thanks, Amity! Up top!
[Amity high-fives Luz. Amity's abomination slaps Luz's face, leaving abomination mud behind. Amity and her abomination walk off.]
Luz: [wipes mud off her face] Blegh! Wow, my first day at Hexside. A chance to discover my true magical potential. And maybe meet a hot yet vulnerable upperclassman.
King: Dream on!
Luz: King?
King: [pops out of Luz's backpack] Boop! [jumps to the ground]
Luz: Why are you in my bag?
King: You're a free ride to the best buffet in town! Nyah! [hops into trash can, comes out with a half-eaten donut] The trash cans here are filled with half-eaten gold!
Luz: Okay, but if anyone asks, you don't know me. [walks away]
King: Have a wonderful school day, person-I-don't-know!
Abomination Student: I really needed to hear that.
[Cut to the main staircase.]
Willow and Gus: Luz!
Luz: Hello, fellow Hexoleos!
Willow: Hello, classmate! [winks]
Gus: You did it, Luz! [summons letters reading out "BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!" Willow glares at him] Sorry, I was, uh, covering all my bases.
Willow: So, do you know who those witches are? [gestures to nine banners] Those are the heads of the main nine covens. Each one excelled at a magic school like Glandus, St. Epiderm, and, of course, Hexside. Are you prepared to enter these hallowed halls?
Luz: Hmm, that's what I'm gonna figure out right now. [goes inside] See you on the other side, friends.
Gus: See you later, Luz. [summons letters spelling out "GOODBYE FOREVER!" Willow glares again.] You know what? I'm uh, I'ma just get rid of these.
[Cut to Principal Bump's office, where he's watching a crystal ball.]
Perry: [on the crystal ball] A terrible development at Glandus High School. Students and teachers were found unconscious and without magic. The cause remains unknown.
Principal Bump: Ha! Take that, Glandus! Looks like this year's grudgby match is going to be a forfeit.
[Door closes.]
Luz: Hiya, Princy-B! Can I call you that?
Principal Bump: Absolutely not. Now, today we'll be visited by the Emperor's Coven for a routine inspection. If we want to impress them, you'll need to join a coven track before they arrive.
Luz: Actually, Principal Bump, I've made my own schedule. [unfurls a scroll] First, Vet Care for Mythical Beasts, then Healing and Dealing, and then after lunch-
Principal Bump: [laughs] Studying multiple tracks at once? No one does that.
Luz: Then I'll be the first.
Principal Bump: [very serious] No, you won't. [holds up rule book with Emperor's Coven logo on it] According to the rules, a good witch needs to hocus-focus. You can only pick one of the nine tracks. [points to the track banners above him] And you do not want to embarrass me in front of the inspector.
Luz: But all the tracks are so cool! Is there some sort of enchanted article of clothing that could sort this out for me?
Principal Bump: Well there used to be, but...
[Flashback to Principal Bump holding the Choosy Hat, a brown classic witch's hat, over a young student's head.]
Young Student: Oh, I'm so excited!
[The Choosy Hat is placed on their head. It turns around, a scarecrow-like face on the pointed part.]
Choosy Hat: And now... I feed! [brim grows teeth and closes around the student's head]
Young Student: Aaa!
[Cut back to the present.]
Principal Bump: [shudders]
Luz: I don't know if I can choose just one.
Principal Bump: Then I'll choose one for you. [points to the track banners] Eeny, meeny, miny, moe! Ah, yes! The Potions track. You humans are filled with liquids, right?
[Principal Bump casts a spell that changes the tunic and cowl of Luz's uniform to the standard greys and the sleeves and leggings to yellow.]
Luz: Oh, I guess I have always liked pouring things into other things.
Principal Bump: I expect you to be on your best behavior. [looks at a corkboard of with pictures of the results of Luz's previous visits to Hexside on it] Based on the costly repairs from recent incidents, we could really use a donation from the Emperor's Coven. Now, off to class.
[He floats Luz through the door.]
Random Student: *screams*
Principal Bump: The Choosy Hat! It broke free.
[Cut to Luz entering Potions 101.]
Potions Teacher: Welcome to a new semester! Let's get stirring! Today we'll make... [grabs potion] fog brews. [smashes bottle on the floor; pops up in front of their desk] Begin!
Luz: See, potions are fun! [pours test tube into cauldron] You could spend the rest of your life studying this, right?
[Something explodes outside. Luz looks out the window. Willow and Selene are facing off as wind blows. Selene grabs a crystal ball, out of which pops a mummy-like ghost.]
Luz: The Oracle Track!
[Willow traces a spell circle that she slams on the ground. A carnivorous flower grows out of the ground and hisses.]
Luz: The Plant Track!
[The ghost and the plant go at each other.]
Luz: [pawing at the window] Wow!
[Yellow smoke from Luz's cauldron has taken over most of the room.]
Potions Teacher: Ahem!
Luz: Sorry! [stirs her cauldron] Sorry.
[The Potions Teacher walks away.]
Luz: [shudders]
Bell: [inhales, rings smaller dinner bell]
[Everyone leaves class.]
Luz: [rotating her shoulder] Ooh boy! Stirring is the pits. What else is on the schedule for today?
[She pulls out a list reading: "Potions for Beginners, Potions in Motion, Potions (Again), Still Potions, Potions 'Till You Die, Potions After Death".]
Luz: Oh, man! I'm sorry, elbow!
[Luz looks up. Selene replaces the crystal ball she had used in the battle in a closet and walks away.]
Luz: A crystal ball. Maybe it can show me if I'm on the right track. No, don't be tempted! It's your first day. Make a good impression. [begins to walk away; pops up at the closet and grabs the ball] Whoa!
Spirit: [comes out of the ball] You will be in trouble very soon.
Luz: Wow! Wait, what'd you say?
Principal Bump: Ahem!
[Cut to Principal Bump dragging Luz through the halls.]
Luz: But I wasn't studying other subjects! I uh... fog brew! [tosses her potion on the ground, which doesn't work] Yeah. I figured that wouldn't work.
King: [climbs out of a trash can] Nyah.
Luz: King! Vouch for my character!
King: Uh, right! I don't know you!
[Luz glares at King as Principal Bump continues to drag her away. Cut to a classroom with bars on the door, which Principal Bump shoves Luz into. The Detention Teacher looks up from his scroll, and Viney, Jerbo, and Barcus look over at the door.]
Luz: What is this place?
Principal Bump: This is the place where all troublemakers go. [turns Luz's sleeves and leggings dark gray] The detention track.
Luz: [gasps] Nooooo! Detention track? But this can't be possible, I-I thought I--
Principal Bump: Yes. Actual detention still needs... repairs. In the meantime, I am keeping all troublemakers far away from the eyes of the inspector. You may try for a new track next year.
Luz: But I'll be back in the human world by then.
Principal Bump: Maybe you'll do better in human school.
[The door closes as Principal Bump leaves. Luz smiles awkwardly at everyone in the room, then sits at the desk.]
Luz: Hello, fellow detentioners. Room for one more? [looks around] I like the little spikeys in your hair.
Detention Teacher: Hey! You all better be quiet, unless you want to scrub the classroom again.
Luz: Hey, don't blame any of them. I'm the one that started talking.
Detention Teacher: Oh hurray. A hero.
[A mop and bucket appear in Luz's hands.]
Luz: [walks off] Aw, farts.
[Viney watches Luz walk off and smiles. Cut to King walking up to a trashcan.]
King: Time to scrounge through the trash- [yelps]
[He jumps in head first. Inside is an empty box of donuts with frosting rings. King licks the frosting.]
Teacher: That's it! I'm sick of someone eating all the donuts in the teacher's lounge. I quit!
[A tie is tossed onto King's head. He tries to take it off and knocks the trashcan over, rolling into a classroom while wearing the tie. The students all stare at him.]
Student #1: Are you our substitute?
King: Substitute? I ain't no desk jockey.
Student #2: Look at his professional looking tie! He must be!
King: Nyah! [hops onto desk] Can it, Fangs! You don't know diddly dang about squiddly squat!
Student #2: Uh, yes, sir! Sorry, sir! [bows]
King: Obedience? Well, what is a teacher if not an authority figure? A king of children, if you will. [runs to front of the room] Yes! I am your teacher! You may call me Mr. King!
[King looks at them all in annoyance and starts clapping. The class applauds. King beams. Cut to the detention room, where the Detention Teacher is asleep and Luz is polishing the bars on the windows. A teacher walks past the window outside with younger kids following her.]
Spider Teacher: Alright, kids. Who wants to go on a field trip to the astral planes?
Braxas: Yay!
Student #3: I do!
Luz: I do.
Willow: Luz!
Luz: Oh, my gosh! I missed you so much. Let me squeeze your faces. [squeezes Willow's face]
Gus: What's going on? We didn't see you in any classes.
Luz: Principal Bump put me in the detention track for mixing magic.
Willow: The detention track? You can't do anything in there.
Gus: You'll learn less than you did before.
Luz: No, I'm better than this. Please, you gotta help me break out.
Gus: Don't worry. We'll get you out, dead or alive!
Willow: [glances at Gus, shakes her head]
Gus: Okay. Alive.
Luz: Aw, you guys.
[Chair squeaks.]
Luz: It's the teacher. Gotta go!
[She turns around and sees Viney very close to her.]
Luz: [gasps] It's you!
Viney: Shh.
[Viney points to the snoring Detention Teacher, then gestures for Luz to follow her. Viney draws a square on the chalkboard with a keyhole in the center, then turns the chalk in the hole like a key. The square glows and swings open, revealing a passageway.]
Luz: Whoa.
[Viney climbs through the hole, then helps Luz through. The square closes behind her.]
Luz: What is this place?
Viney: This is the last room you'll ever see alive. [pauses] Nah, just messing with ya. I'm Viney.
Luz: I'm terrified! Um, I mean... I'm Luz.
Viney: Thanks for standing up for us back there. Not many people would do that. Follow me! I wanna show you something. You're one of us troublemakers now, so you'll get special access to the Secret Room of Shortcuts!
[Viney opens a door, revealing a tower-like room with a spiraling ramp. The walls, floor, and ceiling are covered in doors and windows.]
Luz: Whoa.
Viney: Hey Jerbo! Barcus! You can stop hiding now!
Jerbo: [opens a door] How do we know she's cool, man? How do we know she won't turn us in? [to Barcus] What do you think?
Barcus: [barks]
Jerbo: Barcus says your aura is strong and silly, like a baby's laughter. Welcome!
Luz: Aah! I love secret rooms! Where do the doors go?
[Luz opens one into a hallway where Amity is pacing.]
Amity: [to herself] So, you two go to the same school now, that doesn't change anything. [sighs]
[Luz shuts the door.]
Amity: Huh?
Viney: This place connects the different parts of the school. We found it after being thrown in the detention track. The witch who made it is known as... [gestures to a defaced portrait and wall of signatures] Lord Calamity.
Jerbo: They started this troublemaker wall and we added our names in their honor.
Luz: This place is amazing. I bet you guys can get into so much trouble in here.
Viney: [chuckles] Sure, we can, but we can also do so much more.
[She points to where Barcus is listening in on an Oracle class. Luz walks up and watches with him.]
Oracle Teacher: Remember, seeing the end of a life is the beginning of reading a fortune. We have to work backwards from it to see the truth.
[The teacher folds a fortune teller. Barcus also folds one.]
Viney: We aren't allowed to study any kind of magic, so we study every kind of magic in secret.
Luz: You actually like school?
Viney: Yeah, we might have liked it too much.
[Cut to Jerbo wearing a Plant track uniform in a classroom with Principal Bump.]
Jerbo: [voiceover] I tried mixing plant magic with abominations.
[An earthy abomination grows out from under the flower Jerbo grew. The abomination throws a flower pot.]
Jerbo: [voiceover] Bump was not thrilled.
[Principal Bump gets hit in the face with a wad of dirt. Cut to Barcus (wearing a Potions track uniform), the Potions Teacher, and Principal Bump in a Potions classroom.]
Jerbo: [voiceover] Barcus makes potions with oracle magic.
[Barcus mixes a potion, then dumps a crystal ball into it. The Potions Teacher looks into the cauldron and sees themself rapidly age. They scream and fall backwards, flipping a large cauldron over themself. Principal Bump shakes his head at Barcus. Cut to a Healing classroom, where Viney, wearing a Healing track uniform, is looking at a scratch on a Bard student's arm as Principal Bump enters the room.]
Viney: [voiceover] Mixing healing and beast keeping was slightly unconventional.
[Viney heals the Bard's arm, then draws another spell circle. A young griffin bursts through the chalkboard.]
Viney: [voiceover] But Puddles was a great assistant, dang it!
[Puddles coughs up lollipops and Viney notices Bump glaring at her. Cut back to the Secret Room of Shortcuts.]
Viney: We all want to be in more than one coven track! But Bump just says we need to focus.
Luz: Sounds like Bump's priorities are out of whack.
Viney: I'm glad you're one of us. You've made a great first impression. [pulls out a marker] Would you like to add your name to the troublemaker wall?
Luz: Aw! [reaches for the marker]
Willow: [through the wall] Luz? We're here to get you out of that horrible class.
[Everyone looks at Luz.]
Luz: Eh, they're probably looking for some other Luz.
[Viney stands and peeks through the main entrance. Willow and Gus are looking around the detention classroom.]
Gus: Maybe she already booked it.
Willow: [whistles like she's calling a dog]
Gus: She did say she was better than this place.
Viney: [closes door] Oh. You think you're better than us?
Luz: No, no, it's not like that. I just didn't think I deserved-- I mean, none of us deserve--
Jerbo: Jacques! I should've known you'd look down on us. Everyone else does.
Barcus: [sneezes, captions reading: You have an aura of lies.]
Viney: It's fine, I just... I thought someone finally understood us. But, maybe you should just leave. [points to the door]
Barcus: [gasps]
Luz: I understand.
[Cut back to the classroom, where Gus plays with the Detention Teacher's mustache.]
Gus: Man, this guy can sleep through anything. [grabs mop] I'm gonna test that theory.
Willow: No. We have to find Luz. If only these walls could talk.
[Luz pushes the wall door open.]
Luz: Hey, guys. [slumps onto the floor face first]
Willow: Thank you, walls! [helps Luz stand] We found a way to get you out to talk to Principal Bump.
Gus: We have an expert disguise! [grabs a trashcan] Hop in! It's got holes for your gangly teenage legs.
[Luz looks at the wall as Viney closes the door.]
Luz: Yeah. That's right where I belong.
Gus: And this way the inspector won't see you either.
[Luz climbs into the trashcan. Gus puts the lid on Luz's head. She stands and walks off. Willow and Gus follow her. Camera pans to the still-snoring Detention Teacher. Gus pops up next to him and puts the mop on his face. He continues snoring.]
Gus: Incredible.
[Cut to outside, where a swirl of blue energy appears. It dissipates, revealing the inspector. She walks up the front steps.]
Principal Bump: Welcome to Hexside, inspector.
Inspector: Greetings, Principal Bump. [bows] If everything's in order, the Emperor's Coven will be happy to cover your repairs.
Principal Bump: Excellent. Please come this way. We've prepared a show with some of our finest students.
[Cut to an abomination stomping on stage. It growls and holds Amity up like an figure skater. They pose. The abomination puts Amity down.]
Amity: And that concludes the presentation from the Abomination track.
[Amity and her abomination bow.]
Principal Bump: [politely applauds] That was some real Hexside magic, huh?
Inspector: Yes, this is... good! But let's see if your student can put up more of a fight! [stands]
Principal Bump: Yes, yes-- wait what?
[The inspector slams her hands down on the stage. Her face deforms, revealing that she is in fact a greater basilisk.]
Principal Bump: Is, uh, this part of the inspection?
Amity: Abomination, fight!
[Amity's abomination runs forward and grabs the inspector. The inspector fully transforms into a basilisk and flings the abomination into the air. It growls and swallows the abomination. It slithers toward Amity, who backs away.]
Inspector: The magic at Glandus High was tasty. But I hope yours will be more filling.
Principal Bump: [running between Amity and the inspector] Amity, stay back. She's an impostor!
[Principal Bump draws out a spell circle. The inspector inhales, swallowing the spell circle and draining his magic. His skin turns gray and he collapses. Amity tries to cast a spell, but her magic is also drained, and she falls unconscious next to Principal Bump.]
[Cut to King's classroom, where he is writing on the chalkboard.]
King: Assume a coefficient of ten, carry the two, solve for Y, and that is the way to steal a pie from a windowsill! [he has drawn himself stealing pie on the chalkboard] Also you can eat trash.
Student #1: Finally, some skills we can really use.
King: [pulls out a slice of pizza] And now, for my next lesson--
[Loud growl.]
King: Seriously? It's not even fifth period yet.
[Cut to King opening the doors of the auditorium.]
King: Excuse me! Could you keep it down? Mr. King's trying to mold young minds here!
[The inspector is sucking more life out of Principal Bump.]
Principal Bump: Ugh. Only 300 years until retirement.
[The inspector looks at King.]
King: I can see that I'm interrupting, so I'm just gonna... [screams and runs away]
[Cut to a hallway, where Luz is no longer in a trashcan.]
Luz: [sighs]
Willow: Don't worry, Luz! Once we talk to Bump, we'll get everything sorted out.
Luz: I know, but what's the point if people get hurt on the way?
Gus: That is a fair question. Here's another question. What the heck is that?! [points]
[The Oracle Teacher is running away from the inspector, which is taking over most of a hallway. The teacher stops and casts a beam of light. The inspector slurps the beam of light up like spaghetti. The teacher falls, drained of magic.]
Willow, Luz, and Gus: [scream]
Inspector: [laughs] More cute morsels!
Willow: We may be cute, but we're nobody's morsels! [summons carnivorous plant]
Gus: Time for a power-up!
[Gus gives the plant buff arms. The plant launches itself at the inspector. It catches the plant with its tail and eats it. Willow and Gus both fall, drained of magic.]
Willow: [tries to draw another spell circle] I feel... so weak.
Luz: [runs in front of her friends] Eat this!
[She grabs her notepad and activates a light glyph on it, then throws it in the inspector's mouth. The spell activates, and the inspector screams, spewing out shredded paper.]
Luz: [picks up Willow and Gus] I'll get you guys somewhere safe!
Inspector: It burns! It burns!
Luz: [bursts into the Secret Room of Shortcuts] Guys! I need your help!
Viney: Oh. You're back.
Luz: I'm sorry for hurting your feelings, but please listen! [falls, drops Willow] Argh! Willow!
Viney, Jerbo, and Barcus: [gasp]
Viney: What happened to them?
Luz: Something horrible is loose in the school.
[Luz opens a door to show the inspector draining more students' magic.]
Viney: Don't let it see us! [closes the door] I think that's a greater basilisk. I heard about them in a class. My cousin at St. Epiderm said she saw one, but those things should be extinct.
Luz: It must've attacked the other schools, and now it's come for us. We have to do something.
Jerbo: But if Bump catches us mixing magic again--
Viney: He'd kick us outta school.
Luz: Hexoleos are out there gettin' hurt, and we're the only ones who can save them. We're troublemakers, right? So let's go out there and make some trouble.
[Viney, Jerbo, and Barcus share a look. Cut to a hallway, where the inspector drains Amelia of her magic.]
Inspector: Hungry! Still hungry!
[An ice glyph is thrown in front of the inspector. It activates, summoning a pillar of ice that throws the inspector back. Luz hops in front of it wearing a cloak.]
Luz: From humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise. I've trained with a secret society to discover the power of mixing magic! I am-
Inspector: Dinner!
Luz: Wah!
[Luz ditches the cloak and runs. The inspector slams into the pillar of ice. It rights itself and chases after Luz.]
Luz: Viney! Do the thing, do the thing!
[Puddles flies through the halls and attacks the inspector.]
Viney: Attagirl, Puddles! Jerbo, now!
Jerbo: On it!
[An abomination opens a door in the floor as Jerbo summons several thorny vines. The vines latch onto a door handle in the ceiling. The inspector claws at Puddles and throws her, then falls through the opened door. Luz hops in after it, sending it through the door in the floor of the Secret Room of Shortcuts. Cut to the auditorium, where Principal Bump sits up.]
Principal Bump: Must find help.
[The inspector falls onto the stage.]
Luz: Wooh!
[Luz falls through the ceiling after the inspector, landing on its stomach and flipping off of it to land on the stage.]
Luz: It's all you, Barcus!
Barcus: [barks, grabs the inspector's palm]
Inspector: Where am I?
[Barcus dumps a potion onto the inspector's hand. He squints at it, then his eyes glow.]
Barcus: [yips]
Inspector: What's he doing? What'd he say?
Luz: He's reading your palm, and your future looks bleak.
[Jerbo's abomination pulls at a rope that Puddles cuts with her beak. The rope drops sandbags onto the inspector's stomach. All of the magic it ate is released and returned to the proper witch. Everyone gasps as they get their magic back and wake up. Magic flies through the air as it returns to other schools. Back in the auditorium, Viney heals Puddles's scratched claw.]
Puddles: [warbles, flies off]
Luz: AH! [hugs Viney] You did it! You were amazing! You guys--
Principal Bump: Are in so much trouble. Leaving your homeroom, mixing magic and-- is that a secret hideout?
[Willow and Gus duck away from the open trap door.]
Luz: Yeah it is. But let's think about this, Principal Bump. Why would kids in the detention track need a secret hideout?
Principal Bump: I don't care to know the ins and outs of rascality. [pulls out rule book] But if the Emperor's Coven can send an actual inspector this time--
Luz: Okay, you need coven money. But if you have to hurt your students to get it, what's the point? They saved Hexside. They should be allowed to study what they wish.
Principal Bump: B-but-- [hugs rule book]
Gus: Do the right thing, ya dingus.
Principal Bump: Alright, I'm smart enough to know when I've made a mistake. Which tracks would you like to be in?
All: [gasp]
Viney: Healing and Beast Keeping!
Jerbo: Plants and Abomination!
Barcus: [barks]
Principal Bump: Then so be it. [changes their uniforms to reflect their new tracks] But if any of you cause more property damage, I'm feeding you to the choosy hat. [to Luz] And you?
Luz: Oh, I still can't choose. Maybe it's crazy but I wish I could study a little bit of everything. Whoa.
[Luz gets a full magical-girl transformation sequence as her uniform takes several colors to reflect the different tracks.]
Luz: What's going on? What is this? Whoa-ho! This is so cool. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna study everything!
Principal Bump: You know, only one other student wanted to study every track. [summons Lord Calamity's picture] Unfortunately, she was never given the opportunity.
[With a wipe of his hand, the graffiti on the picture disappears, revealing a young Eda.]

King: Maybe not, but I care about these kids, [tosses coffee in Principal Bump's face] and nothing can change that.
