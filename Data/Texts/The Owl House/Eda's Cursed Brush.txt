[Open on Luz taping a drawing onto the fridge of her hugging Eda, who's drawing a spell circle, and King wearing sunglasses standing next to them.]

Luz: Pretty good, huh?

Eda: [squinting at the drawing] What did you use to draw this?

Luz: Well, it’s a common misconception that the tool is an important part of the process. As long as you’ve mastered the basics... [reaches into Eda's hair and pulls out lipstick]

Eda: Hey, that’s my lipstick.

[Luz draws Owlbert on her hand, then moves it to make it look like his wings are flapping.]

Luz: Hoot, hoot. Then you can use pretty much anything to make a good drawing.

[Luz runs over to the table. She draws a bat monster with baby bats on a piece of bread with a bottle of mustard, then a skateboarding cat on a piece of paper with chalk. She grabs an oven mitt and runs over to the stove, flipping a pan there to reveal a pancake that looks like The Good Witch Azura, who winks.]

Luz: Yep, with practice and study, you can make fine art out of anything. [poses with a smile]

Eda: Yeah, yeah. I mostly ask because I left a cursed pencil lying around here somewhere, and...

[The drawing on the fridge glows orange where Luz, Eda, and King used to be. Cut to a cackling drawn-Luz, holding a knife. She jumps onto the stove, where drawn-Eda grabs the Azura pancake and tosses it in a blender. She doesn't put a lid on before turning it on and makes a mess. Cut to drawn-King tossing a skull through a small window, breaking the wall in the process.]

Luz: I guess it does matter what tool you use.

Eda: Yeah, I'll go get the paper shredder.

Luz: [yells and flinches as she almost gets hit with the knife]
