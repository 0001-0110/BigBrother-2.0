[Open on the Owl House living room. Luz is reading a pamphlet about Hexside, labeled "Hexside Facts and Trivia." It has a picture of Principal Bump on the back along with his quote, "Education is the real magic."]

Luz: King, listen to this!

King: [laying on Luz's stomach] Hey! Less ready, more scratchy!

Luz: [sits up] Sorry! Now that I'll be a student at Hexside, I wanna learn all about it! I've got a new crush, and her name is Education!

King: [bites the pamphlet] Nyah!

Eda: [kicks the front door open] Hey freeloaders! Guess what today is?

Luz: Is it your birthday?

King: Is it my birthday?

Hooty: It's my birthday!

Eda: No! [closes front door] It's human treasure day!

[Eda tosses the Portal Door into the air. It unfolds and opens. Owlbert flies through, dragging a giant sack. The sack tears when he flips it onto the floor, revealing a pile of human garbage. The door closes.]

Eda: [hops onto the pile] Ahh, fresh garbage.

King: Ooo, gimme gimme gimme! [pulls out a teddy bear] Yes! Another worthy addition to my army of terror!

New Guy: I love cuddles and kisses!

King: Truly horrifying!

Eda: [to Luz] Yo, kid. Your trash pile's getting cold. While mine's getting hot! [pulls out a wire clothes hangar] I have never seen such an extravagant earring.

Luz: You can have my trash. Whoa! Did you know that Hexside was built on the bones of its rival school? One it literally conquered!

[Luz shows off the pamphlet, showing a picture of a much younger Principal Bump standing on various Glandus students, being cheered on by fellow Hexside students. The school burns behind them.]

Eda: [now wearing two clothing hangars as earrings and looking in a mirror] Yes I know all these things, I went there. It was the most harrowing period of my life. [to her reflection] Oh, hello.

Luz: Can you imagine it! Me, in the halls of Hexside, studying with Willow and Gus and- maybe even Amity! Amity! Oh cramity! We're supposed to meet so I can get my Azura book back! [runs out, slams door; reopens door] I love you guys!

Hooty: And I love you, Lu--!

[Luz slams the door again.]

Hooty: Aaah!

Eda: Eh, who needs her?

King: Yeah! This bear could be our new Luz.

New Guy: Being without you is just unbearable.

King: No! [throws New Guy] You're unbearable!

-THEME SONG-

[Cut to the market.]

Luz: [running and looking around] Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity. Gotta find that- oh! [Sees the girl in question, wearing a new outfit.] There she is. Hey Amity! Luz is finally here!

[Edirc and Emira suddenly appear in front of Luz, surprising her.]

Edric and Emira: Hi Luz!

Luz: Ah! [falls on her back]

Edric and Emira: [laughing]

[Amity walks over]

Amity: Edric! Emira! Stop bothering her! [helps Luz up] Sorry, Luz, they insisted on coming for some reason.

Emira: [squishing Amity's face] Because we love you baby sister! Ah!

Amity: [shoves Emira off] They've been extra protective and nice towards me to make up for the library incident.

Edric: [leaning in] And we still apologize everyday.

Amity: [shoves Edric away, pulls book out of bag] In any case, here's your book.

Luz: [takes the book] So, what'd you think?

Amity: It was... fine.

Luz: [pulls a drawing out of the book] So fine you drew yourself with Malingale the Mysterious Soothsayer?

Amity: [blushes, destroys drawing]

Luz: This is great! Maybe we could even start an Azura club at school when we're classmates!

Amity: When we're what?

Luz: Surprise! [pulls out the pamphlet] I'm enrolling at Hexside!

Amity: Oh! Uh, sorry, but to be in my class, you need to take a placement exam and prove that you've mastered two spells. [shows the requirements on the pamphlet] I know you have your light thing. Uh, do you know anything else?

Luz: Placement exam? Spells?

Emira: Quit giving her a hard time, Mittens.

Edric: Yeah, of course she knows two spells. Right, Luz?

Luz: Pff. Yeah. 'Course I know two spells! [laughs nervously]

Amity: Because if you don't, they'll put you in the baby class.

[Amity hands Luz the pamphlet back, now flipped to the baby class page.]

Edric: Oooh! Brain idea!

[Edric kneels in front of Amity. Emira leans on Amity's back, trapping her between them.]

Emira: What if we all trained together? We could show off what we know!

Edric: What do you say, Luz?

Luz: Uh, actually, I have other training plans in a very far away place that I have to go to right now. [pretends to walk away] Bye! [actually leaves]

[Cut to the Owl House kitchen. Eda is reading a book titled "Bending Ingredients to Your Will."]

Eda: [humming] Wow, a surprisingly peaceful domestic moment. When will it be ruined?

Luz: [slams the front door open] Edaaaa!

Eda: There it is.

Luz: [runs in] Eda, Eda! Eda! [falls] You have to teach me a new spell right now!

Eda: Sorry, Luz! These vegetables won't cook themselves... yet.

[Eda dumps a potion onto vegetables. They all grow arms and legs.]

Eda: Alright, everybody in the pot!

Vegetables: [scream and run]

Eda: Why do I always think that's gonna work?

Luz: [stands] But I need to know two spells to get into decent classes at Hexside. I can make light glyphs. [pulls one out and activates it]

Eda: [shields her eyes] Aah!

Luz: But at the end of the day, that's the only spell I know. [falls face-first to the floor]

Eda: And whose fault is that?

Luz: [muffled] Yours!

Eda: Hah! Yep. Got me there.

Luz: [stands] Just teach me a spell now. Any spell! It can be the darkest evil.

Eda: Well, I have been researching my texts on wild magic, but I'm much too busy right now. [throws book in the pot]

Luz: Come on Eda! You're the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles. How would it look if your apprentice got thrown into the baby class?

Eda: Hmm. Weaponizing my pride. Well played. Well, in that case, this looks like a job for magic boot camp.

King: [opens back door] Did someone say boot camp? I agree to run it. We'll rise at dawn! You'll carry me on your back as I yell hateful things about your performance!

Eda: Nope. You'll have no part in this. Luz needs to focus, and I can't have her go all weird when you do something adorable.

King: I am not adorable! [stomps]

Luz: Aww, he stamped his little foot!

[King squeals and leaves, slamming the door behind him. It reopens. He slams it again. It reopens. He slams it harder.]

Eda: Now, no time to waste. You'll have to follow my teaching exactly. We gotta go somewhere special.

Luz: Yes!

Eda: A place where magic energy just flows.

Luz: [climbs onto the counter; louder] Yes!

[Cut to Eda and Luz standing in winter gear surrounded by snow.]

Eda: A place like, the Knee!

Luz: YEEEES!

[Luz's cry echoes across the Isles.]

Eda: The earliest witches came to the Knee to develop their magic, drawn to its natural power.

Luz: [gasps] It's beautiful!

[Ruins covered in snow are shown.]

Eda: [gestures to the side] Though, it's not without its dangers.

Luz: [screams]

[A Slitherbeast is gnawing on a tree trunk.]

Eda: The Slitherbeast! Don't worry, if you don't mess with him, he won't mess with you.

[Luz blows a raspberry at the Slitherbeast. It bites through the tree trunk and sniffs in Luz's direction.]

Luz: [yelps, runs off]

Eda: Here's where we'll set up shop.

Luz: I'll definitely learn my second spell here! Gorgeous views, magic in the air. And best of all, we're completely alone!

[A pink light illuminates her.]

Eda: Watch out!

[Eda tackles Luz seconds before a pink fireball hits the spot Luz had been standing in. Eda pops up over the rocks they fell behind with her staff drawn. Luz also pops up.]

Luz: [gasps]

Amity: Sorry, whoever's over there!

Luz: [ducks back down, hides her face with her hat] Forget teaching me a spell, just make me disappear.

Eda: Well, okay, but I've got a 60/40 record of making you re-appear. Oh! You meant... ah, never mind.

[Edric and Emira wave.]

Edric: Hey Luz!

Emira: Luz!

Edric: Hey, it's us!

Luz: Okay, let's do this. [stands and waves] Hey guys!

Eda: Who are they?

Luz: [grabs Eda's jacket] Be cool! If they know I haven't mastered two spells, they'll think I belong in the baby class!

Amity: [walking toward them] What's that about the baby class?

Eda: Only that it's for babies and Luz here clearly isn't a baby. [to a glaring Luz] Nailed it. [whistles and walks away]

Luz: Amity! [slips, poses on the ground] Wha... What are you doing here?

Amity: I'm here to train. I'm trying to beat Ed and Em's highest score on the exam.

Emira: [popping up from behind Amity] Aw, Mittens. That's impossible!

Edric: [also popping up from behind Amity] She still needs to use a training wand to learn new spells. So what are you workin' on? Something powerful?

Luz: Yup! Powerful spells! I'm workin' on one that's so crazy! Eda's a pretty incredible teacher.

Eda: [carrying a basket of snowballs] Luz! I shall now teach you how to identify different types of snow- by taste! [holds out a snowball] Go on, eat the snow. [shoves it in Luz's face]

Emira: Is this some kind of... special magic?

Amity: Ahem. I don't think the Owl Lady wants to show us any of her powerful spells. [leaves]

Eda: [points at her mouth full of snowballs; swallows] Oooh. Brain freeze! Brain freeze!

Emira: See you around, human! Good luck with your, uh, training.

[Edric picks up a clump of snow and tries to lick it. Emira knocks it out of his hand and drags him away.]

Edric: Aw.

[Edric and Luz wave to each other.]

Luz: Eda! Can you please take this seriously?

Eda: You need to take me seriously. Go taste snow without my guidance, see where it gets you.

Luz: [looks downcast]

Eda: Oh. [sighs] Don't worry kid. [ruffles Luz's hair] If you listen to me, soon you'll be doing stuff like that.

[They look at the Blights. Amity reads from Magic 101, then aims her training wand at a tree and draws a spell circle with it. The produced fireball destroys the tree. The battery light on the training wand flashes.]

Eda: And it won't be with some wack training wand, it'll be the real deal. But you have to trust me, okay?

Luz: [nods] Okay. I trust you.

Eda: We've covered snow, so now it's on to smelling moss. [pulls moss out of her pocket] Now the trick is, [shoves the moss up her nose] you really gotta get it up in there.

[Luz's expression falls. Cut to outside of the Owl House.]

King: This is ludicrous! I once led armies. I can lead a dang boot camp! But I have no recruits. [looks at New Guy and Francois] Or do I?

Hooty: Yep! It's your faithful pal Hooty reporting for duty! Up at dawn, taking orders all day long!

King: Ugh, no! You are too desperate! [goes inside, returns with all his toys] Role call! [says their names as he puts them down] New Guy, Aloysius Turtle, Chip, Beefy Bob, Francois. [pause, picks up Francois] Oh, you're perfect already! As for the rest of you, I'm only saying this once so listen up!

[New Guy falls onto Aloysius Turtle.]

King: Huh it's no fun if they don't tremble.

Vegetables: [laugh, throw cooking supplies off cliff; cheer]

King: Ohh okay, alright. [looks between the vegetables and his toys] Yep, an idea is happening!

[Cut to the Knee, where Eda is sitting in front of a fire drinking out of a mug and Luz is walking out from the forest.]

Luz: Ugh. Okay. I've identified the smells of three different rocks, sorted all the twigs from big to small, and found your glove, and your hand. [lifts glove off of Eda's detached hand]

Eda: Ah, I was wondering where that thing went. [screws her hand back on]

Luz: So what now?

[Cut to Amity training with Edric and Emira. Amity sends a jet of fire at Edric with the training wand. He dodges it. Emira summons an arm of snow. Amity blocks and destroys it with a shield. Amity dispels the shield and waves at Luz. Edric uses the distraction to make Amity sink in the snow until only her hand is showing.]

Luz: [giggles]

Eda: Hey. I know my lessons seem weird but this is what wild magic is all about! Making a connection with nature. The earliest witches understood that. Human witches need to understand it too. You wanna learn a second spell?

Luz: With all my heart.

Eda: Then you have to learn from the island. [guides Luz to a rock, makes her sit down] Now look.

[The rock overlooks the Titan. Its Ribs are nearly the same height as the Knee, and Its Skull is towering even from the opposite end of the Isles. Luz stares at the sight in awe as wind blows past her.]

Eda: And think about what the island is trying to tell you. [leaves]

Luz: [takes deep breath] Alright, Luz. Look. Look with everything you've got. Focus. [raises her right hand and speaks through it]

Luz's Right Hand: Focus? On what? On you'll be stuck in the baby class?

Luz: No! Don't think like that!

Luz's Left Hand: Face it, you'll never get a second spell following Eda's lessons.

Luz: Silence, hands!

[A crash gets her attention. Amity has destroyed a pillar with her training wand.]

Emira: [offscreen] Amity! Dinner's ready!

Edric: [offscreen] I caught a bat!

Amity: Edric, don't eat that. [puts her book and wand into her tent, walks off]

Luz: If I wanna be in the same class as Amity, I'm gonna need to learn magic like Amity.

Luz's Left Hand: Great work, Luz!

Luz: Shh! I don't need your validation.

[Cut to the Owl House's kitchen.]

King: Military discipline, cooking! Ha, I truly am a demon for all seasons! [pours the potion from earlier on his toys, except Francois] Just a dash of Eda's secret sauce and I'm the creator of life!

[The toys' arms start moving.]

King: Yes, yes, yes! My loyal recruits!

[The toys all stand on two feet.]

King: Welcome to boot camp! You sure need it. Look at you: raggedy, pathetic, chewed on, you got a button hangin' off of your eye. Pathetic! But I'll mold you worms into... slightly... better kinds of worms. Your first mission: gimme snacks! Your commander is hungry, so pick it up!

[Aloysius Turtle, Chip, and Beefy Bob walk in the direction King pointed, while New Guy walks the other way.]

King: [smacks New Guy] Hey, Private Dingdong, snacks are that-a-way! You better shape up recruit, you're in my boot camp now.

[New Guy's eyes flash red. Cut to the Knee, where Edric is holding a bat. Emira and Amity glare at him.]

Emira: Ed, give me the bat.

Edric: No! If we're not gonna eat it, I wanna keep it as a pet! [runs off]

[Emira and Amity follow him.]

Emira: Get back here before that thing bites you!

[Luz sneaks into the Blights' tent and takes Amity's wand and book. She goes to a ledge near her and Eda's tent, where she kneels down and opens the book. Inside is a drawing Amity made.]

Luz: Huh. Her crosshatching has improved.

[She moves Amity's drawing to show a page titled "Fireball." Under an image of a witch casting the spell is the word "FOCUS" written in runes.]

Luz: Oh man, oh man. [stands and draws a circle with the wand; gasps] Yes!

[She shoots the fireball off. It explodes like a firework.]

Luz: I did magic! I did magic!! [jumps in place] Without drawing anything! This thing is the coolest!

Eda: Hold it right there. What are you doing with that?

Luz: I'm doing magic, what would you have me do? Eat more snow? Lick a rock?

Eda: [pauses] Okay, so maybe my methods are... unique, but so is your magic. Connecting to the island can help you. That wand can't.

Luz: Well, it's already helped me. Just watch what I can do!

[She draws out another spell circle. The power bar on the wand flashes a low battery bar. Luz loses control of the fireball.]

Luz: Wh... whoaaa!

[The fireball goes off further into the Knee. When it lands, birds fly off.]

Slitherbeast: [growls]

Eda: [gasps]

[The Slitherbeast jumps over the trees. A large patch of fur has been burned off over its mouth.]

Slitherbeast: [growls]

Eda: You've angered the Slitherbeast.

Slitherbeast: [growls]

[Cut to commercial. Return to the Slitherbeast roaring.]

Eda: You've angered the Slitherbeast!

Luz: Will it accept a heartfelt apology?

[The Slitherbeast sniffs and sees the still smoldering-tip of Amity's training wand. It growls and runs at Luz.]

Luz: [screams]

Eda: [shoves Luz] Watch out!

Slitherbeast: [grabs Eda]

Eda: [screams, strains]

Slitherbeast: [growls]

Luz: Eda!

Amity: Luz!

[The Blights arrive.]

Edric: What did we miss?

Amity: And what are you doing with my wand?

Luz: Um...

[Amity takes her wand and her book and holds them protectively.]

Emira: Mittens, we've got bigger problems.

[The Slitherbeast advances on them, Eda still held in one claw. It growls at them.]

Emira: [running in front of Luz and Amity] Aw, he's so cute. Can we keep him?

Edric: [runs up with Emira] It's no bat, but we could try.

[Edric and Emira both cast a lasso at the Slitherbeast's hands. It growls and pulls at the bonds. Edric and Emira struggle to keep hold.]

Eda: You got it! Now finish it off!

Amity: I'm on it! [runs forward and tries to cast with her wand, fails] What?

[Amity smacks the wand against her hand, then notices the low battery light. She turns to Luz.]

Amity: Did you use this all up?

Luz: I... I didn't know!

Emira: Come on, Luz!

Edric: Do those powerful spells you were talking about!

Luz: But I don't actually... know any.

[The Slitherbeast growls and frees its hands with a yell. Emira and Edric are yanked into the snow.]

Amity: Edric! Emira!

[The Slitherbeast picks up the Blights, but Amity falls through.]

Amity: No!

[The Slitherbeast puts Edric and Emira into the claw holding Eda and runs off. The captured witches yell as the Slitherbeast goes. Amity and Luz follow them for a bit, then stop, panting.]

[Cut to the Owl House living room, where King's toys have loaded up the couch with snacks.]

King: Yep, keep 'em coming. [to Aloysius Turtle] And don't forget the pretzels this time. [takes bag of chips and opens it] Running a boot camp is tough work, but as my second-in-command, you deserve this.

[King dumps the chips onto Francois. New Guy watches them fall and tries to reach for one.]

King: Hey, hey! Private New Guy! You're not privy to snacking privileges, back away!

[New Guy's eyes glow red again, this time not fading back to blue. He walks off the arm of the couch without breaking eye contact with King.]

King: [yawns] Leading this boot camp has tuckered a little guy out, so Sergeant King signing off.

[King puts a night cap on Francois and himself and closes his eyes. A shadow falls over him.]

King: [opens eyes] Excuse me?

[New Guy is looming over him, his eyes still glowing.]

King: Could you maybe turn down those eyeballs? Trying to sleep.

[He closes his eyes again. More shadows fall over him. King opens his eyes. All of the animated toys are now looming over him, their eyes glowing. Beefy Bob pulls New Guy's string.]

New Guy: Don't you want a hug?

King: [hugs Francois] Ah!

[Cut to the Knee, where Luz and Amity watch trees shake as the Slitherbeast runs through them.]

Luz: What do we do?

Amity: I am going after them. You are staying here.

Luz: But the beast has Eda!

Amity: [advances on Luz] And because of you, it also has my brother and sister! Now stay put. [pauses] You'll only get hurt.

[She draws a circle in the air. A matching circle appears on the ground around Luz. With a flick of Amity's hand, a cage rises from the circle on the ground. Amity runs.]

Luz: Amity! Wait! [gets shocked by Amity's cage] Stupid island. [kicks rock] Ugh! Ow. [sits on the rock, looks at the Titan's Skull] You were supposed to teach me magic.

[She looks up, where clouds are parting to reveal stars. Snow is beginning to fall.]

Luz: But I'll never learn more than this.

[She pulls a notepad and a pencil from her pocket and draws a light glyph. She activates it and watches as it flies into the sky. Stars blink above.]

Luz: Wait. Is that...

[The stars form a constellation in the form of her light glyph. She traces the outer ring with her finger.]

Luz: ...a light glyph? But what does that mean?

[A snowflake lands on her glove. She looks at it, seeing a pattern in the center before it melts.]

Luz: Whoa.

[Determined, she grabs a stick. She breaks a twig off of it and catches another snowflake.]

Luz: It means... magic is a gift from the island. It means...

[She draws the glyph from the snowflake into the snow with the twig, adding a diamond to the bottom. She taps the glyph on the ground, backing away when a small pillar of ice rises from it.]

Luz: ...magic is everywhere.

[Luz grabs the bigger stick and replicates the ice glyph, this time the entire size of the cage.]

Luz: Magic is everywhere!

[She jumps off the rock and activates the giant glyph. The resulting ice pillar grows taller than the cage, launching her through the air.]

Luz: Whoooo--aaah! [lands in the snow] My second spell! [pops out] Thank you, snow! Thank you, island! Thank you, Eda. [pauses] Eda! I have to save her. [She gets out of her hole and runs.]

[Cut to outside of the Owl House. Hooty is listening to loud music through headphones.]

King: [from inside] Hey! How dare you mutiny! Unhand your commander right now! Ah! [is thrown through a window with Francois] I gave you life, I can take it away!

[Arrows and knives land around King.]

King: AH!

Hooty: [knocks headphones off]

King: [rolls over, stands] Hooty, Hooty! Great news, buddy, you can be in the boot camp! First task: destroy the boot camp.

Hooty: Hmmmm, no thanks!

King: What? But you begged to join!

Hooty: Sorry. You said I was desperate, so now I'm playing hard to get. [spins his head upside down]

King: [rages] Grrr! What do you want?!

Hooty: I don't know. What are you offering?

King: Hmm... [holds up piece of chalk]

[Cut to a body now drawn around Hooty, so that he's the face.]

Hooty: Wow, this is incredible! It's so real! You got yourself a deal! [opens door] Hooooot!

[Hooty rips apart King's toys. Stuffing, a button, and an arm land at his feet as he watches from the doorway in shock.]

King: This day shall live in infamy.

[New Guy's head is thrown against the door frame.]

[Cut to the Knee, where Luz runs out of some trees. Growling is heard from a cave obscured with fog. Inside the cave, the Slitherbeast spits purple goop at the wall. It shoves Eda, Emira, and Edric against it. The goop closes around their torsos. The Slitherbeast hops away.]

Emira: Don't worry. We'll be fine!

[Skeletons drop from the ceiling.]

Edric: No, we're gonna die.

Luz: That's right. [pops up with a skull over her face] Death is here. [lifts skull] Just kidding, Luz is here!

Eda: Kid, get outta here! I'm just gonna sneak away when the thing starts eating the twins.

Emira: Wait, what?

Edric: [offended gasp]

Luz: Don't worry, Eda, I get it now. I was so obsessed with learning my second spell, I didn't listen to you. But now I'm gonna save you! [jumps away] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Eda: Well, at least I got to see her misplaced confidence one last time.

[Cut to Amity peeking around a boulder with a serious expression. Luz pops up under her with a similar expression. Amity notices Luz and her expression becomes shocked.]

Amity: Luz!

Luz: [grinning] Hello!

[They both duck behind the boulder.]

Amity: H-how did you get past the barrier?

Luz: Magic! Literally! Now, forget that, because you and I are gonna have to work together if we want to save everyone. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. [whispers to Amity]

[The Slitherbeast returns. It sprinkles assorted seasonings on Edric, Emira, and Eda's heads.]

Eda: [sneezes] Ugh, I hate garlic.

Luz: Hey! You big idiot! [waves her arms] Over here!

[The Slitherbeast turns and growls. It jumps at Luz, who runs. Amity climbs up to her siblings and Eda.]

Edric: Amity!

Emira: Use that fire spell we taught you!

Amity: But I can't do it without the wand!

Emira: Yes, you can. Just focus.

Amity: Okay.

[She slowly traces a spell circle in front of her. It wavers when she concentrates, but a ball of pink fire appears after a moment and she smiles proudly.]

Emira: Cool. I didn't think you could actually do it.

[Amity melts the three of them free.]

Luz: [screams]

Amity: Luz!

[Cut to Luz dodging the Slitherbeast and running out of the cave. The Slitherbeast follows her until she gets to a tree and stops.]

Slitherbeast: [growls loudly]

Luz: Gotcha!

[Luz steps on a huge ice glyph drawn into the snow. She ducks away from the rising pillar of ice. The ice launches the Slitherbeast into the air, it lands hard on its back. Everyone else runs out of the cave. The Slitherbeast rights itself, screeches at the witches, and runs at them.]

Eda: You want me to teach you kids something cool?

Amity and Emira: Yes!

Edric: Yes, please!

Eda: [runs forward, draws complicated spell circle; grunts] Sleep spell!

[Her spell circle passes around the Slitherbeast. It immediately falls to the ground and begins snoring.]

Luz: Now that's my mentor! [runs up to Eda] Did you see? I learned my second spell! I made the connection!

Eda: I saw. [ruffles Luz's hair] Nice work kiddo.

Emira: [sighs] You showed some real bravery in there, sis.

Edric: Yeah, nice work kiddo. [ruffles Amity's hair]

Amity: Grr, stop! [fixes her hair and approaches Luz] So it looks like we'll be in the same class.

Luz: Azura Book Club? Azura Book Club?!

Amity: [blushing; whispering] As long as it's a secret club, okay?

Edric: It's not a secret!

Emira: We're gonna tell everyone!

Amity: [sighs disappointedly]

Eda: [sneezes between them, making them jump] Alright, your adorable banter is literally making me sick. Let's go home already.

Luz: On it, teach!

[Luz draws another ice glyph and activates it. This one is a diagonal pillar of ice that sends them flying.]

Eda and Luz: [cheers]

Emira: I think we can go the normal way. [the trio walk off]

[Cut to the Owl House, where stuffing is raining down in the living room.]

King: Private Hooty, today when the felt flew you showed grit and determination that were instrumental in securing our victory. May I just say, it has been an honor, to be your commander.

Hooty: Sir, the honor is all mine.

King: Private, [hugs Hooty] our hearts have been touched by fire, and-

Eda: Ahem! [in the doorway with Luz, who looks around at the mess] What the heck did you two get into?

King: Um, excuse me? We're having a moment here!

Hooty: You'll never understand what we've been through together! Never! Never!

King: [walks away] Ugh, moment ruined.

Hooty: I will be haunted by my actions forever. Hoot hoot!
