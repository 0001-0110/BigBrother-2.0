[Open on the Owl House living room. King is watching videos on Luz's phone while she uses a magnifying glass to look at a flower.]

Luz: Come on! Work this time. [replicates plant glyph, activates it, gasps when a flower successfully grows] YES! Check it out, King: my glyph skills are blossoming!

King: You think that's impressive? Check this out! Two warriors battling to the death!

[On the phone, two cats meow. One prepares to pounce on the other but falls on its back. Luz looks at the open portal door.]

Luz: Ah. I see we're getting enough Wi-Fi through the portal for cat videos.

King: Senseless violence. Yes, attack! DEATH IS YOUR GOD!

Luz: I regret teaching you about the Internet.

King: Hah! What possible regrets could come from the internet? Oh! Did you know that the Earth is actually flat?

Luz: Yep, that's not right.

[She takes her phone back as it vibrates. She got a text from her mom reading, "How's camp today, cariño? <3, Mamá.”]

Luz: [gulps]

[She starts typing "I", then deletes it. "I'm" and "It" are also typed and quickly deleted. She ends up sending a thumbs-up emoji.]

Luz: Good enough.

King: Ah, a severed hand! Perfect response.

[Luz flops down on the couch and puts a pillow on her face.]

Luz: [muffled] Ugh! What am I supposed to say? [sits up; normal] "Hey mom, not at camp actually! I'm in the demon realm learning to be a witch! Also, did you know that demons and magic are real?" She. Will. End me.

King: Nah, she'd be freaked out by our world anyway. So actually, by keeping the truth from her, you're doing her a favor!

Luz: Hm. The demon on my shoulder makes a good point.

King: Always trust a shoulder demon!

[He takes the phone. Hooty opens the door.]

Hooty: Hoot hoot, Luz! Time to fill up that darling little head of yours with... [regurgitates a stack of books onto the ground] Mm-hmm. Delicious knowledge!

[Willow and Gus look in from the doorway.]

Gus: Please hurry!

Willow: The more I look at him, the more uncomfortable I get.

Hooty: HOOT HOOT!

Luz: Hehe. [finger guns her friends; kisses King's head] Don't spend all day watching MewTube, 'kay?

King: I FORGE MY OWN PATH!

[On the phone screen, a fluffy black cat chases its tail. He snickers.]

King: What a dum-dum.

[He's distracted by his own tail wagging. He tries to catch it but flops on the couch after a second.]

King: Ugh. Who has the energy?

-THEME SONG-

[Cut to Hexside. The spider kindergarten teacher decorates the halls with streamers.]

Spider Teacher: Coming through! Watch your heads!

[The halls are decked out with balloons made of abomination goop and other decorations. Luz, Gus, and Willow enter.]

Luz: Something's different today. Did everyone get a haircut?

Willow: Oh yeah! I forgot you've never been here for the social event of the season.

Gus: Welcome to your first--

[Suddenly, two masked health workers enter, rolling a stretcher, making siren noises.]

Worker: Outta the way!

[The workers surround a beast-keeping student with dark skin, blonde hair that covers his eyes, and big, pointy ears similar to a bat. Skara looks on.]

Worker: Come with us immediately! Your disease- it's advancing!

[They help him onto the stretcher.]

Student: Is there a cure, doc?

Worker: Only one... finding the perfect date to Grom!

Student: If that's the cure... then, Skara, will you go to Grom with me?

[He holds out a beating heart, with "GROM?" written on it in red ink.]

Skara: Ahhhhh! Of course I will, or whatever!

[She hugs him, and onlooking students and teachers cheer.]

Luz: [gasps] You guys have a version of prom on the Boiling Isles? I was kicked out of my last school dance for dressing like an otter, but here, I can be your Grom queen!

Willow: That's, uh, not something people usually sign up for.

[Amity enters from behind, looking down at the stack of books and a note she is carrying, and unknowingly bumps into Luz.]

Amity: Watch it, nitwit! Oh. Hi, Luz... and co. Sorry about that.

Luz: No problem, let me help you!

[She helps Amity pick up her books and hands her a little pink note that she dropped.]

Luz: Here, your note.

[Amity snatches it away.]

Luz: Man, you got some quick grabbers.

Amity: It's just, it's... private.

[The speaker screeches on. Everyone looks at it.]

Student #2: I'm so nervous.

Student #3: Shh! This is it!

Principal Bump: [over intercom] Attention Hexside students. This is your principal speaking.

Gus: Oh, man, this is it!

Willow: He's announcing who'll be this year's Grom royalty.

[Amity looks on, concerned.]

Principal Bump: This year, I have the privilege to bestow our highest Grom honor to... Amity Blight!

Willow, Luz, and Gus: [gasp]

[The three of them turn to Amity, who looks shocked.]

Principal Bump: Our Grom queen!

Other Students: [gasp]

Student #4: It's Amity!

Student #5: Amity.

[Amity is noticeably uneasy.]

Luz: WHOOOO! Amity, get it, queen!

[Luz holds her hand up for a high-five. Amity looks around and runs off.]

Luz: Don't leave me hangin'!

Willow: You might want to give her some space. Being Grom queen is a tough job. Even for Amity.

[Cut to the gym. Students are setting up decorations while Principal Bump oversees. The Snaggleback is hanging from the ceiling by a rope and spinning.]

Principal Bump: Very good. Lower the streamers, fill the punch bowl, and- how's my disco ball?

Snaggleback: Nauseous.

Principal Bump: Great. Just keep it up for 36 more hours.

[Principal Bump leaves the gym. Luz enters.]

Luz: Ah. My first school dance experience on the Boiling Isles. I can't wait to get overdressed, take awkward photos, push all the buttons- wait, what?

[She sees a red button on a black-and-red pedestal with insect legs on the bottom.]

Luz: Well, hello. Don't mind if I do.

[She cheekily pushes the button. The ground rumbles, and the floor opens to an underground arena, connected by a ramp.]

Luz: Woah!

[Two walls of weapons come up from the floor on either side of Luz.]

Luz: [gasps] Medieval torture seems like a strange theme for Grom, but hey--

Amity: [offscreen] They're not for decoration.

[Amity is sitting at the top of the bleachers, alone. She stands up and starts to make her way down.]

Amity: This arena's where I'll make my debut as Grom queen.

Luz: Right. Why don't you seem excited?

Amity: [grabs a sword] Because this isn't just some dance party.

[In the arena, black goop rumbles and growls.]

Amity: That's Grom. Short for Grometheus, the Fear-Bringer. It's a monster that lives under the school.

[She casts a spell that shows a tapestry about Grom's backstory.]

Amity: Every year it tries to break out, and a student had to defeat it before it invades the town. Ever the optimist, Bump holds a party and calls it tradition.

[The tapestry fades back to the gym.]

Amity: The worst thing is that Grom can read minds and shape-shift into your worst fear. And mine... [looks at the blade of the sword] is very embarrassing. [returns the sword]

Luz: If it worries you so much, then why don't you tell Principal Bump you want out of this death match biz? [gasp] Unless talking to Bump is your greatest fear.

Amity: [chuckles] No, but that's a good idea. Thanks, Luz.

[Amity leaves.]

Luz: Hm.

Snaggleback: PUT DOWN A TARP, I'M GONNA PUKE!

[Luz hurries out. Cut to the Owl House, the door to Eda's room.]

Luz: [offscreen] I'm home!

[Poking noise.]

Eda: [offscreen] OW!

[Luz enters.]

Luz: Guys?

[We see Eda in a brown tuxedo with King, standing on a stack of books, wearing a green apron.]

Eda: Careful with those pins.

King: Why am I doing this? I don't even wear clothes!

Luz: Hey, sweet duds, owl lady! What's the haps? [sits on Eda's nest]

Eda: I'm chaperoning Grom tonight. So I have to look sharp.

King: And Gus asked me to co-emcee the fight!

[King holds up a poster of him and Gus, standing back-to-back in sunglasses, Gus holding a microphone.]

King: We're going to turn this blood-bath into a fun-bath!

Eda: Ooh! Have they announced the victim yet?

Luz: Yeah. It's Amity. She's kinda freaking out though. I wish I could, like, take her place or something.

[Eda and King laugh.]

King: A great joke, Luz!

[They continue laughing.]

Eda: Ah, listen, kid. That's a noble sentiment, but Grom is a little above your pay-grade. You're a human. You're... fragile.

[Luz, red with anger, gets up and marches towards Eda.]

Luz: Hey! I've been learning lots of new spells! I could totally handle it.

Eda: There's a horrifying spider in your hair.

Luz: Nope. I'm not as fragile as you think, Eda. And I can't be so easily fooled, either.

[Luz turns around, revealing there is in fact a horrifying spider in her hair. She slams the door as she leaves.]

King: Uh, maybe you were too hard on her. She's saved you from multiple monsters, remember?

Eda: Facing Grom means facing your worst fear, King. And I don't think Luz knows what that means yet.

[She looks at herself in the mirror, pauses.]

Eda: Do you think I could pull off red eyeshadow?

King: Girl, you can pull off anything! Up top! [they high-five] We're style geniuses!

[Cut to the forest. It is dark. Luz is holding a branch and tears through the brush, angry.]

Luz: "Fragile". Eda doesn't know me! I-I'm brave! I'm a bad boy!

[She hears footsteps and yelps.]

Luz: Ominous footsteps, creepy woods. This is no problem.

[She braces for impact and holds up her branch.]

Luz: LUZ CHOP! AAAAAAHHHHHH!

[She lunges forward and unknowingly hits Amity, knocking her down.]

Amity: Ow!

Luz: [gasp]

[Luz pulls out a light-glyph, activating it immediately and holding it up to reveal Amity in the mud.]

Luz: Oh my gosh, Amity! I'm so sorry!

[She tries to help Amity up, though the witch slips in the mud.]

Amity: [sighs] And here I thought this day... Oop!

[Luz pulls Amity to standing. They stare at each other for a second. Amity sits down on a tree stump.]

Amity: ...couldn't get any worse.

[Luz looks around before plopping herself in the mud.]

Luz: Did you talk to Bump? Was it as terrifying as you imagined?

Amity: [sigh] He said no. I'm Grom queen, unless I can find a replacement. And who'd want to switch with me?

[Amity curls in on herself. Luz looks down. Then her face brightens.]

Luz: I would.

Amity: What?

Luz: [stands] Amity Blight, I'll do it. I'll take your place and face Grom in the arena. I'll be your fearless champion!

[The spider that was in Luz's hair crawls onto her face. She screams and faceplants into the mud. Amity looks on, concerned.]

Luz: [weakly] fearless... champion..

[Cut to Luz's room in the Owl House. She rummages through a chest of clothes and pulls out a black dress.]

Luz: Hmmm....

[She pulls out an otter suit.]

Luz: Hmm!

[Her phone buzzes. She picks it up, a text from her mom: "Mira! Visiting our fav after school snack spot !" Then is a selfie of Camila holding a sandwhich outside of a store with a sign reading "Chimichurri Sandwhiches!" Another text reads, "Miss you BEBE! XO" Luz replies "😋". She frowns at her phone. Hooty enters.]

Hooty: Oh, Luuuuuzzzz! You have a gueeessssstttt!!

Luz: [tries to hit him] Hooty! No touching!

[Hooty retreats out the window. The door opens.]

Luz: Amity!

[Amity enters through the door, picking feathers out of her hair.]

Amity: If that bird-tube ever talks to me again, I'm going to destroy it. You ready to train?

Luz: [picks up outfits] Which should I wear to Grom? [holds up black dress] This one says, "witch with a dark side." [holds up otter suit, puts on matching smile] But this one says, "I'm an otter... with a dark side."

Amity: Luz, you need to take this seriously. If you can't defeat Grom, everyone on the island will have to live out their worst nightmare.

[Hooty enters, right up against Amity. Amity scrunches her face.]

Hooty: YOU WANNA HEAR MY WORST NIGHTMARE??

[Camera moves outside of Luz's room. Hooty's body writhes as crashes are heard.]

Hooty: Hooty-hoot! Hoot, hoot!

Luz: Stop, stop! Amity, Amity, wai-- AMITY, STOP!"

[Cut to the front of the Owl House, Amity paces in front of Luz, Emira, and Edric. Behind her, Hooty is now wearing an eyepatch and bandages.]

Amity: Grom will transform into your darkest fears. What are you afraid of, Luz?

[Luz thinks.]

Edric: [to Emira] Wanna say our greatest fears? On three. One, two... being alone forever!

Emira: [overlapping] Being stuck with you forever.

Edric: [groans]

Luz: In preparation, I've made a list!

[She pulls a list from her pocket and holds it out to Amity. She grabs it and reads it. Edric and Emira read it, chuckle, and each draw a spell circle. A huge version of Luz's phone appears. The screen shows a guy tipping a white fedora, and a message bubble that says "M'LADY".]

Luz: [yelps] Jerks online who wanna debate!

[A cat with a human face appears.]

Luz: AH!

Cat: Luz, help me! Help!

Luz: Human souls trapped in cat bodies!

Cat: I don't want to be this.

[A carton of milk appears, floating in the air, and pours milk into a glass in Luz's hand.]

Luz: NOOOO! I'm lactose intolerant!

Amity: Not enough. [walks up to Luz as the illusions vanish] The reason I can't face Grom-- it goes deeper than things that just gross me out. [pokes Luz] What's your real fear, Luz?

[Luz looks up at the window into Eda's room.]

Luz: My real fear... is that Eda thinks I'm too fragile to do this! And if she's right, I'll never be a real witch!

[Edric and Emira look at each other and draw a conjoined spell circle. A giant illusion of Eda rises from the ground, flipping her hair. She looks at Luz.]

Eda Illusion: You're inadequate.

[The Eda Illusion draws a spell circle. Luz is put in a high chair with a bib that says "weak baby". Cut to Eda's room, where the real Eda, now wearing a yellow bowtie, looks at herself in the mirror.]

Eda: Me-ow. Still got it.

Luz: [offscreen] Nooooo!

[Cut to Eda exiting the house into the front yard, bowtie in hand. Emira and Edric look proud of their creation while Amity looks nervous. Luz is wailing like a baby.]

Eda: I get it. Ditch the yellow. [gasp] Is that supposed to be me?

[She looks at the illusion of herself, which smiles down at her.]

Eda: Dang, I look great. [chuckle] Wait a sec. You're training to be Grom queen!

Luz: So what if I am! [falls, yelps]

[The high chair and bib disappear as Eda walks up to her.]

Eda: You think training will help against Grom? Luz, you always go overboard and I end up bailing you out. Now, what's the fun in watching a kid get eaten by a monster if it's my kid?

Luz: Well, maybe you'll have fun watching me defeat Grom!

[She karate-chops the cat, and it disappears. Luz grins proudly. Eda looks worried. Amity puts a hand on Luz's shoulder.]

Amity: Luz, I don't think you're ready, but we're literally out of time.

Luz: I'll take it!

[They smile at each other. Cut to the Hexside gym.]

Snaggleback: Arms so tired.

[Rockabilly-style music is playing in the background. Couples awkwardly dance on the dance floor. Willow dons corsages onto some guests. Eda waits nervously to the side. She looks at her watch, which has King as the arms.]

King: Why so twitchy, witchy? Trying to remember if I've ever seen you this nervous before.

Eda: Well, of course I'm worried! I'm going to have to save Luz from a nightmare monster! Ugh, so much for Mama's fun night out.

[The lights dim.]

Gus: [offscreen] Ladies, gentlemen, and assorted demons!

[Gus is on the stage, in the spotlight, speaking into a microphone.]

Gus: It's almost time for our main Grom event. Please, please, take a seat, and be aware that the first three rows are designated splash zones.

[One guest is sitting in the first row, wearing a raincoat and opening an umbrella. The students cheer. Eda and King sit towards the back.]

King: Wow, Gus is really good at this. They're hanging on his every word!

Gus: [encouraging the crowd to applaud] I see we've got Principal Bump in the house! Now, sir, I hope you won't throw us in detention because, uh, we're going to raise the roof.

[The spotlight goes onto Principal Bump, who is sitting in the bleachers. He makes a raising-the-roof motion with his hands and smiles. The students cheer.]

King: Whoo, I, uh, hope my material's up to snuff. Whoah!

[He drops his card and falls into a sitting position. A whoopie cushion goes off.]

King: What do you think will go better with the youths, close-up magic or impressions?

[Eda grabs King by the collar and holds him up.]

Eda: Oh, King. Teenagers are brutal. They'll boo anyone, and that kind of public humiliation can stick with you for life.

King: Aaahh!

[Cut to the doorway. Amity steps out of the gym and looks around, then down at her note from this morning. She gently smooths it out with her thumb. Luz enters and she quickly pockets the note.]

Luz: I'm not sure if it's nerves or if I accidentally drank some milk, but something's making my stomach squirm.

Amity: Uh, you look nice. Strange, but... nice. [puts her hands on Luz's shoulders] And, thank you, Luz. Honestly, I'm kind of amazed with how fearless you are. You've done things I could never do.

Luz: Hah! Yeah right! You goin' soft on me, Blight?

Amity: [laughs] In your dreams.

[They stare at each other.]

Gus: Now, introducing our Grom queen. You know her, you love her... you've at least heard of her. Luz, the Human!

[The students cheer as the spotlight goes on Luz.]

Luz: [to Amity] Wish me luck!

Amity: [quietly] Luck.

[The pedestal with the red button skitters onto the stage. Gus presses it. The floor opens to reveal the Grom arena. Skara and her date, about to lean in for a kiss, rip off their formal clothing to reveal their Grom jerseys.]

Date: GROM!!!!

Skara: YES, GROM!!!!

[The weapon racks rise up on either side of Luz. She picks up a flail and places an ice-glyph on it. It glows. She ventures into the arena. Grom rises.]

Luz: There you are, Gromarama. Not too scary.

[Grom turns into the human souls trapped in cat bodies.]

Cats: [overlapping] Luz, help me. I'm a man. Make me human again

Luz: Ugh, so weird.

[She swings her flail to gain momentum and slams it to the ground. A pillar of ice rises and rockets out the cats. The students cheer.]

Gus: And there she goes, folks! Using that characteristic human magic to keep Grom at bay! And now, to hand things over to my co-emcee: King!

[The students cheer. King walks onto the stage.]

King: Hel-LO, Hexside! So...

[He drops his cards and the microphone feedback screeches. He tugs at his collar.]

King: Oh, oh gosh. Um... whoooo. Wow, these lights are warm. Observe! Luz, is um... she's down there, all right. And, uh, yes she is! There she goes! Folks, she's battling the thing, and uh...

[The crowd begins to boo.]

Guest: Bring back the funny kid!

King: You will clap for me! Please?

[He throws down the microphone and runs offstage, wailing.]

Gus: King! [goes after him]

[Back in the arena, Luz is fighting the illusion of the online jerks.]

Luz: You're not coming from a place of intellectual honesty, so debating you would be pointless!

[She slams an ice-glyph down, which creates a sharp shard of ice that pierces the illusion and makes it disappear. The students cheer.]

Principal Bump: Luz has lasted surprisingly long. But what form will Grom take next?

Luz: LET'S FINISH THIS! Human-style!

[Grom rises behind Luz, towering over her. An illusion of cursed Eda with glowing eyes creeps towards her. Back in the stands, some kids look at Eda who groans and hides in her hair. The illusion reaches out to Luz's head and makes her eyes glow. It morphs into the portal door. Luz looks at it.]

Luz: Huh?

[The door opens. Camila steps out.]

Grom-Camila: Mija?

[Luz looks on, shocked.]

Luz: Mom! What are you doing here?

[Eda peeks from behind her hair.]

Grom-Camila: Luz, what is this terrible place? Espérate un momento, this isn't camp. Have you been here, all these weeks? [gasps] And is that a weapon?

Luz: Ah! [drops the flail] I can explain!

[The illusion of Camila morphs into Grom. It towers over Luz.]

Grom-Camila: Mija, have you been lying to me?! [growls]

[Luz stares at Grom-Camila, terrified. Cut to the hallway. Gus walks over to King, who is sitting in front of the lockers, looking down. He sits next to him.]

Gus: What's going on, little dude?

King: Nothing! Leave me be! [lays down]

Gus: The thing is, you're sitting in my personal chit-chat zone, which means you gotta talk.

King: Well if that's the rule... Oh, how can this be? I get stage fright! ME! The king of demons!

Gus: Well, sometimes, you just have to--

King: I know, I know. Imagine everyone in their underwear.

Gus: [blushing] GROSS! Why would you do that?!

King: I dunno. I always do that. [chuckle] I am a little weirdo.

Gus: No, King, sometimes you just have to face your fear, like Luz is doing right now.

[Luz slides into the hallway, startled. She runs down the hallway.]

Luz: I can't do it! I can't face my fear!

Grom-Camila: [chasing after her] Why are you running, Luz?

Principal Bump: Grom has escaped.

[Principal Bump and the students move into the hallway.]

Students: He escaped! Oh no! Grom escaped. What are we gonna do?

[Gus stares at the microphone in Principal Bump's hand.]

Gus: King, now's your chance.

[King grabs the microphone as the students chatter.]

King: Gimme! [to himself] King of Demons, you got this. [to crowd] Well, folks, looks like our show literally just took off!

[They look at King, confused.]

King: Weh?

Gus: [to King] You gotta pander.

King: Uh, took off just like your local sports team would take off when they're about to make a goal?

[The students cheer.]

Students: Yeah, sports team! Sports team! Oh, yeah! I love our team!

King: Yeah, that's right, so let's follow them and see what happens next.

[Gus takes King into his arms, and they lead out the crowd. Amity and Eda run out of the gym after them. They nod to each other, determined.]

[Cut to the forest. Luz is running away as Grom follows close behind.]

Luz: I don't wanna be Grom queen anymore! I give up the throne!

[Grom pants. Luz comes up at a cliff and stops just before falling off.]

Luz: [yells]

Grom-Camila: Why can't you face me, Luz? Why can't you face your own mother?

Luz: You're not really my mom! [turns away]

Grom-Camila: How can you say that, cariño?! You're breaking my heart!

Eda: [riding in on her staff] Spicy toss! [hits Grom with a fireball, lands] Hands off my human, you misshapen excuse for a monster!

Grom: [roars]

Luz: Eda! You're right! I'm not ready!

Eda: That's okay, I got this one. [starts casting a spell]

Amity: [makes noise]

Eda: Huh?

[Amity jumps out from the trees and puts herself between Luz and Grom.]

Amity: Stay away from her!

[Grom growls and reaches out an inky arm towards Amity, lifting her high above the ground.]

Amity: I'm sorry, Luz. I should have fought my own battle.

[Grom's eyes glow blue, reading Amity's mind.]

Amity: I-- [eyes glow]

Luz: Amity! No, your fear!

[Grom grows, turning more and more blob-like. Finally, it shrinks and morphs into a humanoid body.]

Luz: Who is that?

[Amity's eyes stop glowing. Grom takes the pink note from Amity's pocket and rips it in half, letting it fall to the ground. Amity closes her eyes, embarrassed, clutching her dress. Grom slinks away. Amity picks up one half of the note from the ground and holds it to her heart. Luz picks up the other, unfurls it, and reads it. It reads, "Will you go to Grom with me? -Amity".]

Luz: [gasps] You were afraid of getting rejected. Amity, it's okay. What if I went to Grom with you instead?

[She holds out her hand for Amity to take. Amity reaches for it.]

Amity: Really?

Luz: That's what friends do.

[Amity smiles, then looks sternly to Grom. It rises and towers above them, roaring menacingly from huge jaws.]

Amity: Well, then, if that's settled, may I have this dance?

[She holds out her hand to Luz. She grins and takes it. They come close to dance, the moon shining brightly behind them. They dance. Luz spins Amity, and Amity casts a spell with her feet, forming a giant abomination below them. They rise up on it. Luz fans out her plant glyph cards. Amity dips Luz, and she slaps a glyph onto the abomination. They jump off, and the abomination goes into Grom's mouth. Green light moves within it, and then plants start to bloom through it. Luz lands, then catches Amity, spinning her around several times before putting her on her feet. As the finish, holding hands, looking at each other, Grom explodes behind them. A giant tree is in its place. The last remnants of Grom slink off. Luz and Amity look up as a tiara appears on both of their heads. They smile at each other.]

Luz: Sooooooo.... who did you wanna ask out?

Amity: [blushing] Oh, it’s...it’s not important.

[She pulls the note-piece from her pocket and tosses it aside. It lands right beside the other half, and unfurls to read, "Luz", for a completed message of "Luz, will you go to Grom with me? -Amity". King runs to the side of the girls.]

King: And there you have it, folks. A happy ending for this year's Grom. Let's give a big hand to our Grom queens, Luz and Amity!

[Luz flashes a toothy smile as Amity blushes awkwardly. The students pop out of the bushes and run toward them, cheering. They parade the girls, holding them up. Luz puts a hand on Amity's shoulder. Eda is clapping for them next to Gus and King.]

Gus: You did it, buddy!

King: Of course I did it! I'm the King of Demons and I've never had stage fright in my life!

[The students hold up King, right by Luz and Amity.]

King: THEY LOVE ME!

[Luz and Amity laugh and smile at each other warmly.]

[Cut to the Owl House. Eda, King, and Luz have just arrived home, Luz looking down.]

Eda: WHOOOO! Watch out for this human! Oh, you did good, kid.

Luz: Thanks, but... I'm gonna go to bed.

[She tosses the tiara to the ground. King picks it up and places it on his head.]

King: NOW I AM KING AND QUEEN! Best of both things!

[Luz enters her room with a sigh. She opens the window and sits on the windowsill, looking out.]

Luz: In the end, I couldn't face my mom. Maybe I am fragile.

[Her phone vibrates. She turns it on to find two texts from her mom: "How was your day? ❤, Mamá!" and "Miss you mija 🤗".]

Luz: Hmm.

[She types a duck emoji. Looking into her room, she changes her mind and types out, "Miss you too, Mami". She sends it, then continues typing.]

Luz: [narrating] I won't lie. Today was kinda hard.

[Cut to Willow and Gus poking some remnants of Grom. For Willow, a ladybug pops out, and she jumps back.]

Luz: [narrating] And I don't always feel like I'm supposed to be here.

[When Gus pokes it, a clown pokes out. He runs away. Fade to Amity sitting in her window, looking out of it. She opens a memory box she has in her lap.]

Luz: [narrating] But when things get tough, my friends help me out.

[Amity puts her tiara in the box and closes it. She closes her eyes and leans against the window frame. Fade to the Owl House living room, where Eda is snoring on the couch. King jumps up and lays on her stomach, then falls asleep.]

Luz: [narrating] I think you'd like them.

[Eda wakes up and looks at King. She smiles, puts a hand on his back, and closes her eyes again. Fade back to Luz sitting in her windowsill.]

Luz: [narrating] Te extraño también, Mami. One day, I'll tell you all about this.

[The wind howls, blowing clouds away from the moon. Luz looks out on the sea and smiles. She receives another text from her mom. It reads: "can't wait! P.S. love receiving your letters!"]

Luz: Aw. That's a cute way of saying "text".

[She puts her phone down and looks out at the moon again.]

[The scene fades to Camila lying in bed, smiling at her phone. She turns it off and puts it on her nightstand, next to a pile of actual letters, seemingly written by Luz. Camila turns and goes to sleep. The camera focuses on the top letter, reading, "Hi, Mom! I am having a great time at camp. Today we learned what mortgages are! I can't wait to get home and see you. Let's do lots of fun mother/daughter activities forever and ever. Love, Your Daughter, LUS LUZ".]

[Cut to a photo album titled "Grom Memories". It flips through pictures of the night: A photo of Cat and the pufferfish student posing awkwardly, trying not to touch. Of Skara and her date pushing them out of the way. Of the two with their Grom jerseys. Of Boscha, Bo, and Selene posing. Of them making silly faces. Of Mattholomule photobombing, with the girls looking angry. Of Luz posing in her Grom outfit. Of her looking over. Of only her boot in frame.
