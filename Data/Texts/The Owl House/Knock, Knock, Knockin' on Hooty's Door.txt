[Open on the Owl House as Hooty uses the typewriter.]

Hooty: Dearest Lulu, I hope this letter finds you well, and that you’re enjoying your time with your parents. I’m writing to let you know, that I am a genius! Whenst I wrote you last, I was in the throes of a malaise. That’s when I got your letter!

[Flashback to Hooty reading Lilith's letter at night.]

Lilith: [narrating] Hello, Hootsifer. Your letter concerned me. You write of feeling unimportant while Luz, Eda and King are off on adventures.

[Hooty looks up to see his friends' silhouettes in Eda's room, Luz leaving with King in her arms before Eda turns off the light.]

Lilith: But Hooty, you are the Owl House. You take care of everyone inside you. If that isn’t a worthy purpose, then what is?

[Hooty coos softly and enters the living room, where everyone is situated on the couches.]

Hooty: How we doin’, Hoot House?

King: Can you keep it [his voice cracks] down? [adjusts his voice] Down! [does it again] Down! Why does this keep happening?

Hooty: [approaches King] Sounds like our little demon is becoming a deMAN!

King: [pushes Hooty away] Ugh! Why does that sound so wrong coming from [voice cracks again] you? YOU! [unintelligible angry noise] I am done with this!

[King runs off.]

Hooty: Ha ha ha! [to Eda] Those teens, eh? Their moods change like the wind.

[Eda lowers the paper she's holding up, revealing the shadows under her eyes, which are being kept open with clothespins.]

Hooty: [taken aback] WHOA!

Eda: I'm freaking out, Hooty. Belos is planning something big, and I'm weaker than a newborn witchling. If I wanna protect you guys, I have to train as hard as I can to get strong! No rest!

Hooty: But every time you overwork yourself, you turn into the Owl Beast!

Eda: I SAID NO REST!

[Eda blows an air horn and leaves, irritating Luz who's lying on the other couch with the echo mouse's terrarium in front of her.]

Luz: Can you please be quiet?! You’re scaring the echo mouse. And if he’s not happy, I’ll never make my way into Amity's heart. [realizes what she just said, a flush spreads across her face] I mean make a portal back home. Uh! We have to go!

[Luz picks up the terrarium and runs out of the room.]

Hooty: You were right, Lulu. These three needed my help. So I devised the plan of plans.

-THEME SONG-

[Open back up to Hooty moving through the halls to the kitchen.]

Hooty: [narrating] Your words inspired me to help everyone, Lulu. So I’ll start with King!

[King is shown on the table surrounded by several books.]

King: Maybe if I figure out what kind of demon I am, I’ll know what’s going on. [swaps one book for another] But nothing in here looks like me!

Hooty: [narrating] Our little bundle of joy was growing up, and he had questions. As the only other demon in the house, I had answers! But would he accept help from me?

[Hooty shakes his head.]

Hooty: Never! Unless…

[Hooty briefly leaves and is soon on top of King, eyes glowing and mouth open. Just as King sees him, the screen goes dark. A moment later, King emerges from an owl pellet in a dark room.]

King: [mad] Ugh! Ugh! AAH! DID YOU OWL PELLET ME?!

Hooty: Are you angry? Sweaty? Is there hair in places? Does your voice crack in a super embarrassing way? I have the answers you seek!

[The lights turn on: Hooty has brought King to the tower, where he's set up diagrams, charts and boards for "Demon Puberty 101.5".]

Hooty: You’re going through demon puberty!

King: [facepalms] UGH! The last thing I want from you is a health class!

Hooty: This isn’t a health class!

[Hooty pulls down a chart of demon traits titled "Who Am I?"]

Hooty: It’s an unholy test, to determine what kind of demon you are!

King: [hopeful] Really?!

Hooty: Yup! Besides, I’m pretty sure I’m the only other demon here, so ha ha, what other choice do you have?

King: Eh… all right. What the heck.

Hooty: YAAAAY!

[He dons a beret/mortarboard and begins the lesson.]

Hooty: Our ancestors arose from the muck of a decomposing titan. And there are so many of us! But all demons can be placed in three categories; bug, biped, and beast!

King: Yeah okay, everyone knows about the three Bs [makes a casual hand gesture.]

Hooty: [gets in King's face] DO NOT INTERRUPT! [slinks back to the board] Now I’m pretty sure you’re not a bug, but we can’t rule anything out. As a type of worm myself-

[Hooty wiggles, causing King to give off a disgusted shudder.]

Hooty: I’m an expert on this subject! LET’S BEGIN!

[Hooty picks King up and has him don dancing clothes. King lets off an annoyed "WEH!" In the background, Hooty's demonology board titled "Bug" shows some demons from that category, including a picture of Adegast. Hooty looks at the board, then turns to King.]

Hooty: Bug types naturally communicate through dance, like so!

[A fairy and a two-faced butterfly give them a brief demo.]

Hooty: [sniffling while crying] Poetic!

[King makes various grunting noises while freestyle dancing. When he stops, Hooty is shown mouth agape and the fairy and the butterfly also look shocked. Then Hooty starts hissing in rage.]

Hooty: DON’T YOU TALK ABOUT MY MOTHER!

[King screams as Hooty chases him. After a moment, Hooty has calmed down and King is panting, with a ruffled fur and a dent in his right horn. In the background, Hooty's demonology board titled "Biped", features some demons from that category, such as Eileen, Selene, Tibbles and Warden Wrath.]

Hooty: Well, your dance was offensive, and your attempt to spin a cocoon was just… Sad. Honestly.

King: [ashamed, hugs his tail] Can we-just not talk about the cocoon?

Hooty: Okay! Let’s see if you’re a biped demon! They walk on two legs and even have bile sacs, just like witches! So for this test, you’re gonna have a duel with a little friend of mine.

[Hooty taps the top of a box, and out comes Tiny Nose playing on a game console.]

King: A scuffle, eh? All right, all right, let’s do it. Just uh… don’t get mad if you can’t-

[Hooty rings a bell.]

Tiny Nose: Hmph!

[Tiny Nose lets out a battle cry, followed by grunting noises as she uses magic to trounce King all while he screams again as a blast of smoke is shown erupting from a window. Once again, cut to King coughing and groaning.]

Hooty: Wow! Heh, not a single spell! Even bug demons have some magic.

King: It-it’s fine! It’s fine. Let’s just keep going.

Hooty: Okay, okay. There’s only one way to test for beast types.

[Tiny Nose pops out of a box wearing a mask and holding a comically large needle.]

Hooty: I’m gonna need a blood sample.

Tiny Nose: I gwaduated fwom medical school!

[Cut to outside the Owl House as a "poink" is heard, followed by King screaming in pain again. Back inside, King is waiting.]

Hooty: After reviewing the results, we’ve come to a conclusion.

King: Lay it on me. Beast, bug, biped, I don’t care. I just want to know what I am!

Hooty: You…

King: [gasps]

Hooty: Are you!

Tiny Nose: [holds a tray with a crumble] Hooway!

King: [confused] Wheh?

Hooty: The blood tests were inconclusive; We don’t really know what you are! But that’s okay! ‘Cause we don’t need to know that to be your friends!

King: [frustrated laugh] I-I thought you had real answers…

Hooty: The only real answer is inside your heart!

[Hooty nuzzles King only for the demon to push him off with a "NYEH!"]

King: I don’t need you to tell me to love myself, Hooty. I want to know where I came from. What my Dad looked like. What I’ll look like when I grow up.

[Hooty takes a look of sadness.]

King: I don’t have any responses to my video, yet, or my wanted posters. Maybe my Dad is gone, maybe there’s no one else like me, and I’ll live my whole life without any answers!

Hooty: NO! I didn’t want to make you mad.

King: [angry, on the verge of crying] Well I am mad, at him, for not being here! [sniffles as a few tears fall] He left me... ALONE!

[Upon saying that, he emits a soundwave that blows up all the balloons and the crumble as it disperses. Back in the tower, King is panting hard before he notices the damaged decorations.]

King: Huh?

Hooty: [downhearted] Oh no. Now I’m sad, too.

Tiny Nose: At least the cake is good.

Hooty: IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CRUMBLE!

[Hooty backs out of the window.]

King: Hooty? Hooty!

[Break. Scene cut to Hooty sadly returning to the front door.]

Hooty: [narrating] Things got a little, uh, messy with King. But I wasn’t about to give up! [regains his confidence] What Eda said confused me; how could she get stronger, if she’s bone-tired? And maybe I was being a Nervous Nellie, but I couldn’t shake my fear of the Owl Beast coming out.

Eda: [pacing] Me? Sleep? HA! Not until I can call myself the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles once again!

[Eda comes across a plate of cookies.]

Eda: Hmm. [reads the accompanying note] A reward for all your hard work. Love, Hooty Hmm. Not a bad idea. I could use the fuel.

[She takes a bite of one.]

Eda: Dang, owl boy can bake.

[She takes another bite only to detect something: she rubs some crumbs between her fingers and see "Zzz"s making snoring sounds.]

Eda: Sleeping nettles?

Hooty: YUP! One bite will put you to sleep for hours!

Eda: Sleeping nettles don’t just put you to sleep, they heighten your dreams! Do you realize who you just stuck me with?

[She starts to hear growling.]

Eda: Hooty, don’t let me fall asleep!

[She shakes him, only for him to fall over with only a portion of his body shown.]

Dream Hooty: YUP! One bite will put you to sleep for hours! [echoing] For hours! For hours!

Eda: You know, maybe this is an opportunity. The Owl Beast is why I ran away from home. The Owl Beast is why I never got close to anyone. And the Owl Beast-

[The beast appears.]

Eda: Is why I don’t have magic.

Owl Beast: [growling]

Eda: Ha, you’ve haunted me long enough, bird brain. I think it’s time for me to haunt you. Huh?

[Eda's a teenager again, and she's in her old room. She looks in the mirror.]

Teenage Eda: Huh. Well, this is a development.

Gwendolyn: [offscreen] Edalyn, come downstairs please!

[Teenage Eda comes down, seeing her mother materialize setting up the table. Lilith (also a teenager) appears soon after.]

Teenage Lilith: [holds up a swan-shaped napkin] Mother, do you like my napkin folding?

Teenage Eda: [groans]

Gwendolyn: [not looking] That’s nice, sweet flea. Edalyn, help us set up, won’t you?

Teenage Eda: Sorry, dream Mom, I don’t have time for... whatever this is. I’m on a mission.

Gwendolyn: [laughs] You’re going to say that, the night your dad leaves for the mandible?

Teenage Eda: Dad?

[As if on cue, her father comes in the front door.]

Dell: Hey Pumpkin! Here to see me off?

Teenage Eda: Dad! [hugs him, choking up] It’s so good to see you again.

Dell: I was only gone for an hour. Hey! I know I won’t be home for a while, so that’s why tonight...

Teenage Eda: Wait… I remember this, now.

Dell: ... I’ll be leavin’ in style!

[Dell sets off a party popper with purple lights. Teenage Eda gasps as she starts to transform. Teenage Eda watches as her father holds the beast back.]

Teenage Eda: No! I won’t let you ruin this again!

[She grabs the owl beast and throws it out the door. When she shuts it, she's back to her present day appearance. Eda turns around and sees her teenage self on her knees sporting feathers. They look at Dell groaning in pain and he holds hid bleeding left eye.]

Gwendolyn: Dell! Lillith, call the Healing Coven. Now!

Eda: It wasn’t your fault. IT WAS YOURS!

[Eda raises her fist, unaware she's a young adult now and was dating Raine.]

Raine: Eda, I- [sees Eda] WHOA! What are you doing?!

Young adult Eda: UH! [gasping for breath] Raine! HAHA! Uh, nothing! I'm fine! [nervous laugh]

Raine: [saddened] You’re lying again. It’s like I don’t even know you. So, I’ve made a decision.

Young adult Eda: Okay okay, I know how this plays out. I hope that I’ll be ready this time. You hear me, bird brain?!

Raine: I’m joining the Bard Coven, and...

Young adult Eda: No no no, I hate this part.

Raine: I think we should see other people. I’m sorry, Eda. It’s over.

[Eda starts gasping and groaning. Her hands are growing claws and feathers. The Owl Beast is heard growling.]

Raine: [concerned] Are you okay? Is this the curse?

[As Eda is panting, her present self grabs her shoulders.]

Eda: Just tell them! Let them help!

Young adult Eda: Ha ha! It’s fine! Everything’s normal! You can leave now!

Raine: I can’t do this anymore.

[Raine turns their back and fade away.]

Eda: Stop pushing them away!

[However, when the young adult Eda puts her hands down, the Owl Beast can be seen instead]

Owl Beast: [jumps away from Eda and screams.]

Eda: [gets angry] You!

[Eda jumps onto the Owl Beast's back and angrily grabs him.]

Owl Beast: [screeching]

Eda: It was always you!

Owl Beast: [howling]

Eda: [grunting and struggling]

Eda: It was all your fault! STOP. RUINING. MY. LIFE!

[Eda tries to headbutt the owl beast, only for it to disappear and her surroundings to turn black as she becomes the beast. The beast is standing over a cliff, purple light flares hit the ground in front of it. When it retreats, it's captured within a net. A mysterious figure appears from behind the net, with a cloak that is gray with black suns on one side and black with gray moons and white stars on the other side.]

The Collector: [evil cackling] Don’t bother, beast. You can’t run away anymore. It’s over.

Owl Beast: [frightened screech]

The Collector: [evil cackling]

[The Owl Beast falls into the boiling sea, transforming into a scroll. It washes up on the shore near Bonesborough and is picked up by a merchant. The merchant looks at the scroll in confusion at first, then shrugs indifferently and places the scroll in a basket with other flotsam. A ways away, Eda is sitting on the shoreline, seeing the tiny Owl Beast trying to fly away, but it can't since it's tethered to Eda by a red thread. Eda sees an elixer bottle and picks it up. The Owl Beast sees it and starts screeching.]

Eda: [tenderly] It’s okay.

Tiny Owl Beast: [upset screeching]

Eda: [looks at the elixer] Now I thought these were a way to fight you, but... I think they’re the reason we can stand here face to face. Listen, neither of us want to be here, but... we are, and there’s no changing that. If we can’t accept each other, this nightmare will never end. So what do you say? Truce? For now?

[Eda pours some elixer into her hand, and the tiny Owl Beast starts drinking it.]

Eda: [laughs and snorts] It’s like sandpaper.

[The beast curls up in Eda's lap. Suddenly, color starts stretching across the sky.]

Eda: Wow. I’ve never had a dream this pretty.

[A white light envelops them. Back to the real world, Eda has woken up, but only her shadow is seen. It seems to be bigger and has wings.]

Eda: [gasping for breath, voice is deeper] Ugh, my head! Huh? Oh jeez, did I turn again?!

[Eda looks in a mirror and lets out a startled gasp: she's taken the form of a harpy.]

Harpy Eda: [stunned] … whoa.

Hooty: [upset] I made it worse. I MADE IT WORSE!

[Hooty starts to leave.]

Harpy Eda: Hooty wait, it’s okay!

[Hooty started sobbing hysterically and left.]

Harpy Eda: Hooty!

[Eda looks in the mirror again and lets out a wolf whistle.]

Harpy Eda: Oh girl, this is a hot look.

[Break. When we return, we've been taken to the inside of Luz's room.]

Luz: [offscreen] You’re scaring the echo mouse. And if he’s not happy, I’ll never make my way into Amity’s heart. [embarrassed] I mean make a portal back home. Uh! We have to go!

[Luz runs into the room with the terrarium, still blushing, and closes the door with her foot before slumping against it and letting out a sigh.]

Luz: [looks in the terrarium] Okay, little mouse. If you don’t want to tell me about Philip or how he made his portal, maybe you can tell me how to ask out a cotton-candy haired goddess?

[The Echo Mouse gives her an uninterested squeak and turns around.]

Hooty: [narrating] Luz’s heart was torn between finding a way home, and the pursuit of love. How do I know all that? I suppose I’m just attuned to other people’s emotions.

[Actually, he was in the room when she wasn't paying attention.]

Hooty: She wasn’t going to make any progress if her attention was split.

[Hooty puts on a determined face and backs out of the room.]

Luz: Amity’s smart, cool, and classy. Asking her out should be breathtaking! Emotional! And real! Everyone back home said I was cheesy. Can’t let Amity think the same!

[Someone knocks on her door. When she answers, she finds nothing but a card on the floor. She picks it up.]

Luz: [reading] As we stumble through life, gloom knows no bounds. You’ll only find love… when you’re in the ground?! Ugh.

[She turns the card around.]

Luz: P.S. I mean the basement. [shouts] Hooty, I don’t have time for this! [confused] Also, we have a basement?

[Luz enters the basement holding a ball of light. When she's reached the bottom of the the stairs, she sees a shadow resembling Amity.]

Luz: [shocked] Amity?!

[Upon closer inspection, it's just the shadow of a lampshade. In front of the lamp itself is a large owl pellet.]

Luz: [relieved] Oh yeah, that’s silly, why would Amity be in our-

[The owl pellet starts moving and muffled noises are heard. It splits open, and gasping for air, out comes Amity.]

Luz: [horrified] AMITY?!

Amity: [surprised] Luz? Where are we? [holds her head, trying to remember] I think Hooty brought me here?

Luz: [flustered] Uh, well, this is our basement. I am so sorry about this. [helps Amity up] Hooty’s been acting weird all day.

Amity: [equally flustered] Yeah heh… house demons get like that, after a couple thousand years. [she puts some distance between them] It’s fine. Listen. About what happened, at… my place. I kinda… if we could just forget about the whole thing? Maybe? I-

Luz: Hey! Uh! All I care about is getting you out of our dirty weird basement!

[When she gets closer, she triggers a trapdoor that sends them stumbling into each other. Turning red due to the positions they're holding each other in, they scream as the floor beneath them gives way and sends them down a tunnel; Hooty looks down it with a hoot. The girls reach the bottom and land in a pile of pillows. The second Luz sees where they landed, she lets out a terrified gasp as the cherub embroidered on a pillow winks at her.]

Luz: [quietly] Oh, no.

[Luz incinerates the pillow with a fire glyph, causing Amity to scream barely avoiding it. Luz scrambles out of the pile and catches a falling card.]

Luz: [reading] To return to the world above, make your way through the tunnel of- [gasp]

[Lights turn on to reveal a tunnel of love, complete with swan boat bearing Hooty's face.]

Luz: [quietly] If Amity sees this, she’ll think I’m such a loser!

Amity: [curious] What is this?

[Luz cups her face and lets out horrified groan.]

Hooty Ride: Hooooooot! [It wraps around the girls and drops them in the boat.]

Luz and Amity: Whoa! Ugh!

Tunnel of Love: ♫I'll conjure up some flowers♫

Luz: [takes a deep breath] HOOTY!

Tunnel of Love: ♫ We could hold wholesome hands for hours You'll be my sweetheart My sweetheart My wholesome magic sweetheart ♫

[As they enter, Luz buries her face into her hands mortified. Amity looks to the side and sees a giant heart saying "I think you're smart, cool and classy." Flattered, she gives off a small smile and her whole face glows as she starts playing with her hair.]

Luz: [anxious] Oh no. I’m gonna be made fun of again.

Amity: Did you- um- did you just say something?

[Before Luz can answer, she sees another display: two bees surrounding a heart saying "Amity bee mine".]

Luz: NO! [tears down the display, gets up holding an antenna] That was- uh- an invasive species.

[Giggling is heard from a cherub prop that fires an arrow into the water. Said arrow has a note that reads "U R A QT". Luz gives a terrified yelp as more arrows are fired at them.]

Luz: [deflects the arrows with the antenna] I’m so sorry, Amity! This is not supposed to happen!

[Amity's face starts to fall. As more displays sing, Luz, unable to take anymore, blows one of them up and lets out a battlecry as she uses glyphs to destroy everything, completely unaware of the look of despair Amity now has. It isn't long before the ride stops. Luz emerges from the water, gasping for air.]

Luz: [panting] This… was a nightmare.

Amity: [morose] Yeah… it kinda was. [gets out of the boat and starts to leave] I’ll… get out of your hair.

Luz: Amity, wait! This wasn’t me, this was all Hooty’s stupid idea!

Amity: Yeah, this was stupid. I mean, us? Dating? Heh. That’s stupid, right?

[Amity turns around, wiping away a tear. Luz gasps but before she can explain, Hooty, shedding his own waterworks, pops up between them.]

Hooty: NOOOO! I DID IT AGAIN!

[Hooty retreats back to the front door once more.]

Hooty: [hysterical sobbing] I CAN’T HELP ANYONE!

[He starts trying to free himself from the door again, like he did before.]

Hooty: OUT! OUT, VILE OWL! RID THIS HOUSE OF THYSELF!

[King, still in the tower, looks out the window.]

King: Hooty! Calm down, you ding-dong!

Hooty: NEVER SHALL I CURSE THIS HOME WITH MY ODIOUS PRESENCE AGAIN!

King: [falls out, hangs from the windowsill] Aahhh!

Hooty: [stops sobbing] Looks like I have to do this… the hard way.

[King looks away as Hooty successfully escapes the door and starts tearing through the ground. Eda, still in harpy form in the house, spots King right as he falls.]

King: AAAAAH!

Harpy Eda: [catches King] Oop!

King: [surprised] Eda?!

Harpy Eda: Don’t worry. I think it’s a good thing! But where’s Luz?

[The girls have gotten out of the basement through a cellar door.]

Amity: What’s going on?

Luz: I don’t know, but things always get weird when Hooty’s upset.

[The ground rumbles.]

Luz and Amity: Whoa!

[The tower starts to break apart.]

King: Luz! LUZ! RUN! [struggles in Eda's grasp]

[A piece of the tower falls towards the girls and unable to clear away in time, they crouch down.]

King: NOOOO!

[King sends off a sonic wave that destroys the piece. The girls look up and gasp as they see the atmosphere caused by it, Luz staring at Amity for a moment.]

Harpy Eda: [amazed] Did you do that?

King: I… I think I did? I think I got a power!

[Eda takes them down and lands by the girls as they stand.]

Harpy Eda: Are you two okay?

Luz: Whoa. Not as okay as you! Dang girl! I have a few questions for later.

[Hooty rushes past them still crying his eyes out.]

Hooty: I FAILED YOU ALL! I FAILED YOU ALL!

Harpy Eda: [reassuring] No no no, Hooty! You actually weirdly helped me! I’m like a harpy woman now!

King: [proudly] And I can explode things with my voice powers!

Hooty: BUT I STILL FAILED LUZ!

Harpy Eda: Luz, what was Hooty trying to do?

King: Quick! Pretend he helped you, before he destroys everything!

[With no way to avoid it, Luz takes a deep breath and beckons them to come closer. Eda uses her wing to give them some privacy.]

Luz: [whispering] He was trying to help me ask Amity out.

Harpy Eda: [whispering] Oh, whoa. Do you wanna?

[Luz sneaks a glance at Amity, who's focused on Hooty, then turns back blushing and nodding.]

Luz: [shyly] Mm-hmm.

Harpy Eda: Then do it!

Luz: Like this?! [gestures to Hooty, now rolling on the ground]

Harpy Eda: Yeah, I hear you. I might be able to help. It won’t be perfect, but huh, does it really need to be? Good luck, kid!

[She takes flight with King still in her arms and grabs Hooty before flying high in the sky. Working up the nerve, Luz turns back around.]

Luz: Amity?

[The ground beneath the girls collapses, leaving them in a crater. Luz regains her senses and checks on Amity.]

Luz: Oh my gosh, Amity, are you okay?

Amity: I’m all right.

[Luz helps her up.]

Luz: I was just… I’ve been wanting to ask you something for a while. But I wanted to do it in the best way! And in the tunnel of love, I thought: “Amity’s too cool for this.” [turns red]

Amity: [embarrassed] I’m not as cool as you think.

Luz: Okay. Everything is so crazy right now, and I have no idea what my future holds, but it would be so cool if you were in it. So… uh…

[Luz stares at the ground, then takes several deep breaths but before she can say anything Amity interrupts her.]

Amity: [quickly] Do you wanna go out with me?!

Luz: [exhales] Nooo I was so ready…

Amity: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, you can say it.

Luz: [sighs] Okay. Amity Blight, do you wanna go out with me?

Amity: Yes! [laughs]

Luz: Okay!

[Unsure of what to do now, Luz timidly holds out her hand and Amity takes it into her own.]

Luz: Why is this still so scary?

Amity: I don’t know.

[Up in the sky, Hooty's still crying but now it's tears of joy he's giving off. King gives him a look while Eda watches the girls.]

Harpy Eda: Dang, Hooty, you really are something.

[It turns out the crater is in the shape of a heart. Cut to the next day, where everyone is in the living room.]

Hooty: [narrating] King may not know where he came from, but he’s learning more and more about himself every day!

[King uses his sonic wave to shatter a glass. He attempts to use it on the crystal ball but is stopped by Eda sporting claws.]

Hooty: [narrating] Eda can become Harpy Eda now! She still drinks her elixir, but she’s accepted the Owl Beast as part of her. IT’S PROGRESS!!!

[Eda looks at her apprentice with pride.]

Hooty: [narrating as the girls study the echo mouse's notes] And Luz’s new GF showed her tips and tricks to get more information from that old human’s diary.

[As Luz writes down the info, Amity starts staring at her. When Luz notices, they both look away laughing. Hooty smiles at them.]

Hooty: They’re adorable, and deserve all the happiness!

[Fade back to the present.]

Hooty: I had to promise never to help anyone ever again, but nevertheless, I’m a genius!

[He places his letter in the mailbox.]

Hooty: Everything solved! No more mysteries!

[A shadow looms over him.]

Possible relative of King: I beg your pardon. Would you see this finds its way to King Clawthorne?

[The demon leaves a letter with King's name on it and departs. Hooty looks at the letter (a bug walking over it) and gasps.]

Hooty: OH MY GOSH, A BUG!

[He eats the bug and the letter in one bite.]

Hooty: Ahhhh. Whoopsie! Hope that was junk mail!
