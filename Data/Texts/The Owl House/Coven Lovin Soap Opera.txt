[Open on Luz sitting on the couch, watching King flip through channels on the crystal ball, looking bored out of his skull.]

Announcer: And now, the epic return of "Bleeding Hearts," the epic romance.

King: [groans in frustration and walks away]

Luz: Ooh.

Rich Witch: [slides in on a pile of snails] Miss Arabella, if you marry me, our families will be the most powerful witches in the land. [pulls Arabella closer] Plus, I'm super rich.

Poor Villager: [rolls into frame, as he is a giant egg with hair and a face] No, Arabella, I scrambled here as soon as I heard. I may be just a lowly stable boy, but our future could be sunny side up.

[Sirens wail as a hospital bed is dragged into frame.]

Arabella's Mother: Arabella, my only daughter, you must know one final thing. Egh. [dies]

[Heart monitor flatlines.]

Arabella: [gasps] Mama. Mama!

Rich Witch: Poor Arabella. I cry diamonds. [does just that]

Poor Villager: My angel weeps. [cries a sunny-side up egg]

[Screen goes static. Cut to Luz holding the remote, clearly disappointed in what she just watched.]

King: [flies back into frame, holding the crystal ball] No! What happens next? What happens next?

[Luz quickly turns it back to that channel, looking worried.]

Announcer: And this concludes the final episode of "Bleeding Hearts."

King: WAH! [tosses crystal ball into the ceiling]

Luz: Buddy, let me tell you a little something about fan fiction.

King: [squints suspiciously] Go on.
