[Open in the Emperor's castle, where Belos has completely rebuilt the portal. He has an Abomaton inject a green substance into the door lock before using a pieced together key to open it. However, the key is instantly vaporized. Nearby, Hunter observes the test when Flapjack flies by and chirps.]

Hunter: [quietly swats it] Shoo!

Emperor Belos: Would you like to see how it works, Hunter?

[Hunter gasps and hides Flapjack before approaching.]

Hunter: I didn't mean to hide, Emperor Belos.

[Belos turns around, his maskless face is revealed to have a green scar.]

Emperor Belos: We found every piece of the door. But without the power of the real key, it refuses to open.

Hunter: [curious] Is it true that rain doesn't boil in the human realm?

Emperor Belos: It is. You know, I've been there before. Did I ever tell you that?

[Hunter shakes his head.]

Emperor Belos: The trees there are green, the nights are quiet... I look forward to seeing it again. Were you spying on me just to hear these boring stories?

Hunter: The operation at the knee, why did you switch me out with Kikimora?

Emperor Belos: Everyone has a use, Hunter. Kikimora has her intricate little plans, the scouts carry out orders, and you... well, the Titan has big plans for you, and it would such a hassle to find a replacement. So, right now, you can be useful by staying safe in the castle.

[Belos escorts Hunter out of the room.]

Hunter: If this is punishment for failing my last mission, I swear I can do better!

Emperor Belos: Good night, Hunter. [closes door]

[Unsatisfied, Hunter turns and runs off.]

-THEME SONG-

[Amity is walking in a hall of the Owl House holding a clipboard.]

Amity: Hooty, what's your status?

Hooty: [breaks through a window] The perimeter's secured. Nothing's getting past me!

Amity: Good. [walks off] Clean up that mess.

Hooty: Ma'am!

[Hooty sweeps the broken window pieces away with his neck.]

[In the kitchen Willow, accompanied by Clover, places bags down on the table.]

Amity: Willow, have you gathered the supplies?

Willow: [salutes] Yes, we are ready to attack this on all fronts.

Amity: [gives a thumbs up] Excellent!

[A white cat comes up to her, leaving a dead spider at her feet.]

Amity: Aw, Ghost, did you help too? [gives Ghost a chin scratch] Who's a good palisman? Great, now all we need is-

[Gus and King enter. Gus is holding CDs while King has a speaker, a disc hanging off his intact horn.]

Gus: Rain, beach wave...

King: Something called Lo-fi beats to study and relax to. We've got it all!

Gus: Eda was rummaging through her basement, and gave us some soothing human noises.

Amity: That's great! Wait, Eda's still here? [enters the living room] Eda, you're supposed to be helping Hooty build our defenses! Huh?

[Eda's busy clenching with an intense look on her face, until she lets out a scream.]

Eda: Whoo! Ah don't mind me, I'm just learning how to turn into Harpy Eda on command. According to these human workouts, you just gotta scream a lot until you force your inner beast out.

[Eda starts grunting and screaming again, while an unnerved Amity picks up a VHS box titled Dragon Claw Z and looks it over.]

Amity: Uh, this looks ancient.

Eda: [takes the VHS box] What? No, it's only... [surprised] 30 years old?! I remember seeing this in theaters.

Amity: Yes, you're old, who cares? We have a crisis on our hands!

Eda: Chill bossy boots, everything's fine!

[Cut to Luz's room. Amity pushes the door open for her and Eda.]

Amity: [gestures] Does this seem fine to you?!

[Luz is lying on the floor, still dressed for bed, wearing socks on her hands and completely delirious. A small, humanoid abomination is holding a box of tissues next to her.]

Luz: Whoa... it's like I have snakes for arms.

Eda: [calm] Please, she just has the Common Mold. It's harmless!

Amity: But she's a human, we have no idea how it'll affect her!

Luz: [sits up, pulls out the portal key] If I ate the portal key, would I return to the human realm?

[Luz attempts to eat the key but the abomination snatches it and gives it to Amity.]

Luz: [reaches out] Um?

Amity: [puts the key around her neck] I am not giving this back until you're better, okay?

[Luz pouts and whines before pulling out a game device and texts on it. Amity takes out her own device, the symbols reading U R PRETTY from the side. She lowers it and sees Luz beaming.]

Amity: [not understanding it] Oh, uh, you got it!

[Amity closes the door while Luz makes a confused expression. Everyone has gathered outside her room.]

Willow: I gotta admit it Amity, seeing you around more often is... different.

Amity: I know. But I was taught to see every situation as an opportunity. And today, I'll show Luz that I am an awesome girlfriend!

King: Feels like just a few months ago you almost got her dissected by your crazy principal!

Gus: That was a few months ago.

[Luz screams. Amity and Eda burst into her room.]

Amity and Eda: Luz!

Luz: Mouse, Philip diary entry!

[The echo mouse has indeed begun a projection. Luz has a notepad and pencil ready.]

Philip: After five years, I have finally found it. A power source so potent it can pierce through realms... Titan's blood. There are old tales of lakes reflecting green trees and blue skies. The Titan's vein runs through the land, and many believe that these wild portals are created when a little of its blood leaks into the water. That is how I came here, so that is the first place I shall look. I will journey back to... Eclipse Lake.

[The projection finishes. The echo mouse squeaks and scuries off as Luz seems to be drawing a picture of Eclipse Lake.]

Luz: I have to go to Eclipse Lake! [runs towards the door] Ah!

[Luz attempts to jump out the door, forcing Amity to duck while Willow and Gus back away, but Eda catches her by the waist mid-jump.]

Willow: [pushes her friend back in] Luz, no! You are not well.

Gus: [in the room] She is shockingly strong!

[They tie her up in her sleeping bag and toss her on the floor.]

Luz: Ugh!

Eda: [looking down at Luz] Alright Luz, me and King will get your Titan blood if you just CALM. DOWN.

King: [jumps on Eda's shoulder] Yes! Perfect chance to take our new powers for a test drive!

Luz: You guys are the best. [hands over her drawing to Eda, who starts to leave]

Amity: [raises her hand] I volunteer as well. [follows] As Luz's girlfriend, I must-

Eda: I get it, boots, just grab a coat. Willow, Goops, watch over Luz. She thinks she has snakes for arms.

Luz: Whoa... [gasps, then hisses at them causing Gus to flinch]

[Cut to the Knee, where several scouts and Abomatons are shown mining. Kikimora is standing on an Abomaton's shoulder.]

Kikimora: [shouting] Dig faster scouts!

Guard Captain: Kikimora, these tunnels are unstable, maybe we should slow down?

Kikimora: Ugh! Not now, captain. This could be my last chance to show Belos what I can do, and I just know that brat Golden Guard will try to spoil it. Hey, Steve! Jump over that chasm before I throw you in it!

[Kikimora's mount walks forward.]

Guard Captain: [sighs, shakes her head] She's getting so paranoid.

[Nearby, Hunter, wearing a coven scout uniform, hides behind a tree. Flapjack is flying near his head.]

Hunter: [spots the palisman] Ah! Why do you keep following me?

[Flapjack chirps.]

Hunter: I don't speak palisman. Here's the plan, I slip in with this disguise, I find the Titan blood before Kiki, I give it to Belos, boom! I'm useful again!

[Hunter is forced to duck when the Abomaton fires a shot that destroys the tree.]

Guard Captain: Ma'am, is everything alright?

Kikimora: [suspicious] I just thought I heard an annoying voice.

Hunter: [running off] Ah another way in, we'll find another way in.

[Flapjack chirps again. Hunter stops and sees a problem walking nearby.]

Hunter: [gasps] The Owl Lady and her dog, and is that the youngest Blight?

[Both witches are dressed for the weather, staffs in hand. Amity has the map and is looking at it as she leads the group.]

King: This place is crawling with tools. What gives?

Eda: Titan blood is the most powerful source of magic on the isles. I'm not surprised Belos wants it too.

Amity: Well we can't afford to mess this up. Luz is counting on me!

[Eda and King shoot her a look.]

Amity: I mean, us.

Hunter: Alright, new plan. They can lead us to...

[Flapjack grabs his hood and starts pulling him forward.]

Hunter: What? Hey, hey, AHHH!

[Hunter falls down the slope, right in front of the small party. The witches raise their staffs.]

Amity: [gasps] A coven scout! [conjures a fire spell]

Hunter: [raises his hands] Uh, yes, I am but a humble scout and I surrender.

King: Well, that was easy!

Eda: [curious] Not so fast, King. Don't you recognize that annoying voice?

Hunter: [slightly hurt] Why does everyone say that?

[Hunter attempts to escape.]

Eda: Don't let him get away!

[Amity summons a jar on her waist and uses the Abomination goo within to tie up Hunter.]

Hunter: Argh! [falls down, mask comes off] Hmph!

[The trio surrounds him.]

Eda: This is none other than Belos' right-hand man.

Amity: [gasps] The Golden Guard? He is a lot... scrawnier than I imagined.

[King laughs while Hunter growls.]

[Break. Scene cuts to inside a section of the mine. Eda bursts through a wall with a flip and lands.]

Eda: Huh-uh! Did I do it? Did I go into harpy mode?

King: [enters through the hole] No, you just screamed "hoot" and ran headfirst into a wall of ice. Pretty funny actually.

[As King walks forward, Amity pushes a captive Hunter through the hole with her staff.]

Hunter: You can put down your staff, I won't run.

Amity: Too bad, because I don't trust you.

Eda: [looks at some mining equipment] Huh, this stuff is old.

Hunter: Ancient witches used to mine the veins for Titan blood-

Amity: [bluntly] They're not paying attention.

[They look at King sitting on a drill-like device as Eda stands in front of it.]

Eda: Go on, fire it! Maybe the adrenaline will kick in and bam! Harpy Eda!

King: Sounds perfectly safe! [activates the drill]

Hunter: [shouts] Wait! Don't-

[But it's too late: the drill fires off a beam that bounces around the walls. When it heads for the teenage witches, Amity stops the beam using an abomination sphere. Eda and King stare at them.]

Hunter: This isn't a normal cave! These walls are made from the veins of the Titan. Any magic you shoot will bounce right back at you!

Eda: Huh, you must be fun at parties. Hey King, how about you use your new powers to echolocate the lake?

King: Haha, okay!

[King stops at a tunnel, takes a deep breath and lets a sonic wave out.]

King: WEHHHHH!

[A few moments pass until King looks at his companions and shrugs "I don't know."]

Hunter: [deadpan] Those two are definitely gonna get us caught.

Amity: Us? There is no us. Now keep walking.

[Hunter shrugs and they move on, Flapjack chirping as it follows close by. Back at the Owl House, the three caretakers are in the kitchen: Willow's making a pot of soup while Gus and Hooty are sitting at the table.]

Gus: Hooty, we're not gonna make Luz listen to 24 hours of whale noises. What even is a whale? It looks terrifying!

Hooty: Well, I've never heard of underground Korean hip-hop before!

Gus: It's human music and it's soothing! [Hums music]

Hooty: [tries to impersonate a whale, moving to the music]

[As they go on, Willow starts to get annoyed.]

Willow: [turns and shouts] Will you guys please be quiet?!

[Gus and Hooty silently stare at Willow.]

Willow: What if, we play them at the same time?

Gus and Hooty: [turn to each other with glee] OHHHHHAHHHHHH!

[Cut back to the mine where the owl party marches on.]

Eda: You know, Luz told me about a trip to Latissa where she met someone very interesting.

[As they go, Flapjack is shown flying around and perching on rocks.]

Eda: "A beat-up blonde with no magical powers," she called him and these are her words: A bad but sad boy.

[King bursts out laughing as Hunter turns pink.]

Hunter: [angrily] If I ever see that human again-

Amity: [points at Hunter] Watch it.

Hunter: Well at least I'm not delusional enough to think I can turn into a harpy.

[Eda stops to turn around and hiss at him.]

King: Hey come on, give it a rest you two.

Hunter: Yeah, listen to your rat.

[King makes an angry indignant noise and grabs Hunter's hair.]

Amity: Shhh!

[They peek over a stone wall and find the scouting party has stopped.]

Kikimora: Why are we stopping? Is it the Golden Guard?

Guard Captain: No ma'am, this is a dangerous area, we need to move carefully.

Kikimora: [raving] Careful takes too long. My butt is on the line and so help me Titan, if you ruin this, I will throw you off the tallest peak of the knee with a smile...

Eda: [watching in pity] Oh, that poor girl is going through something.

Amity: She's also blocking the path to Eclipse Lake.

Kikimora: I can smell it, I can see it, I can see...

Hunter: [quietly] We should create a distraction.

Eda: [loudly] We should create a distraction! You kids wait for my signal. [runs off with King]

Hunter: [leans on the wall, relaxing] Huh, that was easy! When they're caught, you and me can take the Titan blood for ourselves.

Amity: Stop talking like we're a team!

Hunter: We might as well be. The Owl Lady and her pet have nothing at stake unlike us.

Amity: You have no idea what you're talking - [her game device beeps: she briefly places her hand over her pocket] I was gonna say, you have no- [game device beeps again]

[Hunter gives her a look. Amity grunts, turns and takes out the device to check the messages. The device reads U R RAD.]

Hunter: [peeks over to look] Oof, that doesn't look good.

Amity: [points at him] Stay back! [pauses] But what doesn't look good?

Hunter: Seems clear to me. Come back with results or else... You can figure out the rest.

Amity: No, Luz wouldn't make that kind of threat. I'm an awesome girlfriend.

Hunter: Has she told you that?

[Amity just grunts.]

Hunter: We have a lot in common, Blight. We're both trying to show what we can bring to the table. And we can't fail, 'cause there's nothing worse than disappointing someone who thinks you're special.

[Amity looks down sadly.]

Eda: Okay watch this, [pulls her hair over her face, makes it look like a different face] I'll be the ghost of miner's past and spook'em out!

King: You look like one of my hairballs. Let's just do the trench coat thing!

[A magenta fireball flies between them.]

Eda: Ah!

[The fireball nearly hits Kikimora, causing the Abomaton to activate a shield to protect the scouting party. Eda and King rejoin Amity and Hunter, now making a break for the tunnel.]

Eda: Why didn't you wait for our signal?

Amity: We don't have time to play around. We are getting that Titan blood!

[As they go, Amity's game device falls out of her pocket without her realising it. Back at the Owl House, Luz is playing with the echo mouse's ears.]

Luz: Little mouse, owl house, frilly blouse, boop!

[Luz taps the echo mouse's head, and it starts showing the rest of Philip's diary entry on Eclipse Lake.]

Philip: My journey to Eclipse Lake has been a success, and yet a tragic failure. The tunnels were filled with a substance known as Fool's blood, signifies a decaying vein. I was lucky to get out alive, my companions... were not.

[The projection ends.]

Luz: [gasps] Oh no, I gotta warn them, gotta call!

[She reaches for the crystal ball, but accidentally knocks it over, breaking it.]

Luz: Dang it!

[In the kitchen, Willow, Gus and Hooty are wearing headphones connected to a sound mixer.]

Gus: These two are train whistles in a thunderstorm and soothing opera screaming.

[He plays it, and the mixer makes many noises, including the sound of train and thunder.]

Luz: [offscreen] Willow? Gus? Hooty!

[It's no good: they can't hear Luz or even see the soup boiling on the stove. Gus begins to tear up from the music.]

Luz: Guys! [falls] Ugh! I gotta reach Amity! [gasps, sees her game device]

[Back in the mine, the Abomaton catches the fireball.]

Kikimora: There's someone else in the tunnels. I bet it's him, find him!

[The Coven scouts and the captain run ahead. Kikimora finds Amity's device and picks it up. In the tunnel, Flapjack keeps trying to sit on Hunter's shoulder.]

Hunter: Hey! Find a different perch, bird.

[Amity and Eda gasp. They've found dark blue orbs.]

Eda: Is this... Titan's blood?

Amity: [looks at the map] But Eclipse Lake is farther ahead.

King: Who cares? We did it!

Hunter: STOP! That's Fool's blood, don't touch it.

Eda: Oh, so you can keep it all for yourself? Pfft, hard pass!

[Eda cracks open Fool's blood, which cracks the floor. Eda chuckles nervously.]

Eda: Huh?

[The crack on the floor widens, and Eda and King fall into it screaming.]

Amity: No! [prepares to mount her staff]

Hunter: Wait! Take me with you!

Kikimora: [offscreen] Yoo-hoo, Golden Guard!

[Kikimora's shadow is seen from the wall. Amity gasps.]

Hunter: At least untie me so I can escape!

[Amity hesitates.]

Hunter: Please, I don't want to be replaced.

Amity: Ugh, fine! [unties Hunter] So, where will you go now?

Hunter: Now... [knocks Amity down]

Amity: Ah! [grunts]

Hunter: [hops in a minecart] I get to Eclipse Lake before anyone. BYE!

[Hunter heads down, Flapjack following him once again.]

Amity: That jerk!

[Her hand bursts into flames but before she can do anything, a shadow looms over her.]

Kikimora: Hoo, would you look at this, captain?

Abomaton: [grunts]

Kikimora: We found our little fire starter.

[Break. Resume on Kikimora pacing, the captain looming over Amity down on the ground.]

Kikimora: So... the Golden Guard is also looking for Titan's blood, and he took off to Eclipse Lake! Haha, I knew it. That little snake is always making me look bad. Well now I can get my REVENGE!

Guard Captain: [clears throat] Ma'am, what about the Titan blood?

Kikimora: Oh yes, I'll get that too.

[Kikimora claps her hands, and the Abomaton turns into a minecart she hops into.]

Kikimora: [evil chuckle] This is going to be a good day!

Guard Captain: What should we do with the girl?

Kikimora: Oh, I don't care

[Kikimora and the Coven Scouts ride the minecarts down the shaft with glee. The captain turns to Amity.]

Guard Captain: So uh, did you come with anyone else or...? Ugh, this is boring!

[The Guard Captain grabs Amity and throws her down the crack, tossing down her game device not long after. Amity screams until she's caught by something, narrowly catching her device. It turns out Eda caught her, and she and King stopped falling after jamming her staff against the walls.]

Amity: [climbs up] Guys, you're okay!

Eda: Oh, just barely. Owlbert's knocked out so we can't fly.

[Sure enough, Owlbert's got swirls in his eyes. Beat.]

King: I'm just like throwing it out there, but this would be a great time to bring out Harpy Eda.

Eda: I don't know how! I've tried yelling at it, scaring it-

[Owlbert hoots in pain, he's starting to crack.]

King: Did you ever think about, talking to it?

Eda: Hah! I... I guess I didn't but it- it's a wild animal.

King: You thought I was a wild animal once.

[Owlbert cracks even more.]

Eda: Okay I'll try, just... ugh, give me a second.

[Eda shuts her eyes. A few seconds pass.]

Eda: What? You want to make a deal? Wait I- I don't know if I can!

[Owlbert hoots again, cracks spreading further.]

Eda: Okay okay, I'll do it, just change NOW!

[Eda transforms into a Harpy and flies out carrying the kids in her arms and her staff with her foot.]

Harpy Eda: Aha, YES!

King: What did you promise to do?

Harpy Eda: I don't want to talk about it.

[As they go, Owlbert detatches from the staff and flies into Eda's hair.]

King: I can't wait to see a real life minecart chase!

Harpy Eda: Huh?

[The scouting party's minecarts have crashed. Kikimora grunts, then faints. Everyone winces.]

Harpy Eda: Ohhh.

King: Guess minecart chases are a lot more dangerous than video games make'em seem.

[As King speaks, Amity spots and reclaims her confiscated staff. She also spots a sign marking the entrance to Eclipse Lake.]

Amity: [points] There it is!

[Eda flies towards the tunnel, but an Abomaton grabs her by her leg. The captain is standing spear in hand.]

Guard Captain: [grunts] I don't know who you freaks are, but that blood belongs to Kikimora!

[With a surprised yelp, Eds gets flung to the ground. Everyone recovers.]

Harpy Eda: Get to the lake, I'll take care of- AH! AH! UGH!

[Eda is flung into the wall.]

King: Eda!

[Amity grabs Kings and runs ahead. The Guard Captain throws her spear at them, but Harpy Eda catches and breaks it.]

Harpy Eda: Alright Owl Beast, let's see what we can DO!

[Harpy Eda flies above the captain, and performs a drill spin on her. Amity and King reach Eclipse Lake. Amity checks the map (sporting an image of Luz in the lake) and lowers it to look at Hunter digging with a puzzled expression.]

Hunter: [resigned] Don't worry, I won't pick a fight, there's no Titan blood.

Amity: Then why are you digging?

Hunter: [slightly unhinged] Hoho it's simple really, Belos needs Titan blood to make a new portal key. Can't get to the human realm without it!

Amity: [realizing] There's blood in the key?

[Amity clutches the key, which she brought with her.]

Hunter: Since I failed my last mission I thought: "Hey, a chance to make up for it!" But I can't go back empty-handed! [laughs hysterically] Not again. Long story short, this is my grave. [happily] Want me to make you one too?

King: This is really bumming me out.

Hunter: That's just life, rat. Everyone has a use, and if you don't [blows raspberry] bye bye! Your friend gets it.

King: [looks at Amity] What's he talking about?

Amity: [takes out her device] Luz has been sending me these strange human codes. I don't understand all of them but, this one seems pretty clear. Come back with results or we're done.

King: Nyeh! [rotates the device 90° clockwise]

Amity: [reads] U-R-RAD. [clicks the next one] FOOLS-BLOOD-BAD. U-OKAY? COME-HOME? [laughs] Of course! This is Luz we're talking about!

Hunter: Hey!

[Hunter is lying facedown in the dirt. Flapjack is tugging on his cloak.]

Hunter: Go find a better witch to be with.

[Hunter sadly groans as he gathers dirt on his head. Amity kneels near him and once Flapjack notices her, he flies onto her shoulder.]

Amity: You know, you were right. We do have a lot in common. I grew up thinking everything was an opportunity to justify existing, but there are people out there who won't make you feel worthless, you just... have to let yourself meet them.

[Amity reaches out her hand to Hunter. He looks at it only to notice the portal key. He gasps and slowly gets up.]

Amity: [confused] What are you...?

[She realizes his intention and gasps. Hunter lunges at her attempting to grab the key, but misses when she dodges.]

Amity: Oh come on, being nice usually works for Luz!

[Hunter tries again, only for King to scream at him with Flapjack blocking the sonic wave in staff form. Hunter grabs him and tries to teleport but barely moves much.]

Hunter: [surprised yelp] Real staffs are weird! Ah!

[Amity ties Hunter up but he makes a few escape attempts before succeeding. He fires several energy blasts from the air, causing Amity to dodge using her staff. Hunter appears behind her but King tackles him. Hunter teleports around Amity three times, but she blocks him with abomination goo. By the fourth time, she anticipates where he'll pop up and jabs with her staff before punching him with an abomination gauntlet. She proceeds to make a spell circle to summon an abomination behind Hunter that envelops him. Amity gets on her staff to put some distance between them, grabbing King along the way. However, Hunter manages to escape by going underground and punching them with a stone fist sending them in the air. King lands with his horns lodged in a vein while Amity lands using her goo. Hunter appears behind her again.]

Hunter: You really wanna help? Then give me that key!

[He uses his staff to yank the key away, but Amity grabs it as Hunter pins her arm to the wall, with her keeping a goo spike at his neck. The two glare at each other, Hunter panting.]

Hunter: [worn out] Listen, you're strong, and I'm tired. If this continues, you'll probably escape. But here's the thing, we know where to find you, and your human.

Amity: [gasps]

Hunter: So just... hand over the key.

[Amity squeezes the key so hard, a crack is heard.]

Amity: [defeated] Fine, just... stay away from Luz.

[Amity drops the key into Hunter's hand.]

Hunter: [walks off] Appreciate it. I uh- mean that, too.

[Amity says nothing as he flies out on his staff. Harpy Eda flies in.]

Harpy Eda: Haha, yes! I heard fighting, I'm ready to go. Where's that nerd?

[She sees King trying to get out of his position while Amity sits on her knees wearing a grim expression.]

Harpy Eda: Ah. Dang it.

[Cut back to the Owl House, where Luz has fallen asleep.]

Luz: [snores] Huh? [sits up, pillow falls off her head revealing several mushrooms on it, pats face] I feel great! [sees and touches the mushrooms] I wonder if this is permanent. [gasps] I gotta find everyone!

[Luz charges out of her room shaking off the mushrooms only to bump into Willow, the bowl of soup she's carrying flies up and is caught by Hooty.]

Hooty: Safe!

[Steam rises from him, which causes Gus to cringe.]

Luz: Have the others returned?

[They run to the living room, where King and Amity are trying to pull Eda through the door as Ghost walks off with Owlbert on its head.]

Harpy Eda: Ow ow ow! Just get an elixir. Ugh I got into harpy mode and now I can't get out.

King: [to the kids] She also ate like, nine voles on the way home.

Harpy Eda: Hey, I had to keep up my end of the bargain.

[They finally pull her in, but fall to the floor.]

King: OOF!

Amity: [holds her head] Ugh...

Luz: Amity! [happily hugs her] I'm so glad my awesome girlfriend is okay.

[Amity's look of surprise turns into a blushing smile.]

Amity: Me too! [hugs Luz back]

King: No King hug? What is this? [points at Amity] You are a swindler and a thief!

Luz: Come here buddy! [hugs King tightly]

King: I regret this!

Harpy Eda: [to Amity] You wanna break the news or should I?

Amity: News?

Harpy Eda: [counts off] The empty lake, the Golden Guard, losing the portal key, pfft, today was a disaster.

Amity: Actually... we might be okay.

[Amity looks at her glove now stained with Titan's blood. Fade to the portal key, cracked and leaking blood as Hunter holds it up. Flapjack flies up and chirps.]

Hunter: Oh, hey! You stuck with me the whole time, huh, bird?

Flapjack: [chirps]

Hunter: I think I understood that! I-Is that your name? Can you say it again?

Flapjack: [chirps]

Hunter: Hahahah, weird. Can you say other things?

[Hunter begins to walk down the slope with Flapjack following with a chirp.]
