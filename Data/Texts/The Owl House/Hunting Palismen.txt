Kikimora: The Day of Unity approaches, where we'll celebrate the purification of magic under the coven system, just as the Titan intended. As heads of the nine covens, we celebrate your efforts to complete this plan. For this, you have earned a glimpse of the reward that awaits.

Emperor Belos: Step forward. The larger your covens grow, the more power we have to unite our realms, where the worthy shall inherit an utopia free of wild magic.

[Emperor Belos grunts in pain and clutches his chest. The Golden Guard helps Belos up from his throne. Kikimora attempts to follow, but the Golden Guard stops her.]

Golden Guard: No. Stay here. I can handle this alone.

[Kikimora glares at the Golden Guard as they walk away. When they are alone, Emperor Belos transforms into some kind of sludge monster. He then proceeds to punch the wall repeatedly, until he slowly backs away, and puts his mask back on. The Golden Guard hands him a Witch's Staff. He quickly breaks it and absorbs the green essence through his eyes which turn green before changing back to blue.]

Emperor Belos: [sighs] I need more. [reaches out]

Golden Guard: That was the last from our reserves. The Palistrom wood has been overharvested.

[Emperor Belos turns away.]

Golden Guard: Uncle, let me help! We can make more Palismen! Actually, I read about this technique: harnessing wild magic to-

[Emperor Belos stares back at him.]

Golden Guard: Uh...sorry.

Emperor Belos: [places a hand on Golden Guard's shoulder] Please, be careful. Our family is gone because of wild magic. I can't let the same happen to you.

[Cut to outside the throne room. Kikimora is shown listening in on them.]

Emporer Belos: [from behind the door] Find me more Palismen. I can depend on you, right?

[Narrowing her eyes, Kikimora runs off.]

-THEME SONG-

[Open in Luz's room, where the echo mouse is seen resting in a terrarium. Luz, in pajamas, looks at it.]

Luz: Oh, little echo mouse. You ate the diary that can get me home. Can't you cough up a teeny bit?

King: Just squeeze it out! [grunts as he squeezes his teddy bear so hard, the head pops off]

Luz: Hmm. Maybe I just need to be patient? [presses her face on the glass and whispers] Please tell me your secrets.

Eda: [enters, wearing a blazer] Hey, knucklehead. You're gonna be late for school.

[Luz doesn't respond, focused on the echo mouse.]

Eda: Aright. I guess you won't be getting a magic staff with your classmates.

[As soon as she finishes that sentence, Luz zooms out of the room dressed for school and waiting at the front door.]

Luz: Come on, Eda. We gotta fly!

Eda: There we go.

[Eda walks out the door. Luz quickly follows after and shuts the door behind them.]

[Switch to Hexside grudgby field, where several students have gathered and a large object rests in front of them. Eda and Principal Bump are also there.]

Luz: Hey, Willow. Shouldn't Amity be here?

Willow: Oh, sorry, Luz. I heard she stayed home today.

Luz: Oh. [chuckles] That actually makes sense. [looks down, saddened]

Principal Bump: Good tidings on this momentous day.You're all about to recieve your witches' staffs and, more importantly, meet your Palisman. This is a crucial step in your magical development. Palismen are lifelong partners. They can be both your good friends and a powerful tool. In my case...

[Bump snaps his fingers and Frewin opens his eyes, jumps off his head and turns into a staff, revealing Bump's body length black hair and the scar on his right eye, his left one closed.]

[The class gasps in awestruck.]

Luz: Holy Titan!

Principal Bump: ...Frewin here, helps me see.

Eda: [stepping forward] Now, traditionally, young witches carve their staffs from the branch of an old Palistrom tree.

Principal Bump: But sadly, Palistrom trees are becoming more rare. And those that remain are guarded covetously.

Eda: That's why I've teamed up with Bumpipoo...

Principal Bump: Never call me that.

Eda: ...to bring you...

[The Bat Queen flies down and lands on the object.]

Bat Queen: Palisman adoption day!

Luz: They're so cute!

Eda: Thanks for the favor BQ. Here's your whistle back.

Bat Queen: Save it for another time. This was my pleasure. What a wonderful idea.

[One of the palismen, Flapjack escapes the shelter, but Bump picks them up and puts them back.]

Principal Bump: Nope! You're staying right here.

Luz: Aw. Little rascal!

Bat Queen: These little ones have not had homes in many years. They want to feel a connection. Kneel and state your deepest wish, and your like-minded partner will find you.

Boscha: [rolls eyes] Ugh, I want my own Palisman, not some trashy hand-me-down.

Willow: Your loss! [shoves Boscha as she runs up to the nest] I want to be strong and wise to protect everyone I love. And if anyone gets in my way, they'll feel the sting of defeat.

Bat Queen: Tender yet tenacious. Clover gives her support.

[Clover, a bee palisman, flies out of the shelter and over to Willow. She chitters.]

Willow: Oh! [Clover transforms into a staff] Oh, my gosh! I'm gonna take such good care of you.

Gus: Beautiful. Just beautiful.

Boscha: [pushes Willow] Outta my way! I want to play professional grudgby!

Bat Queen: [chuckles] A competitive spirit. Maya will be thrilled.

[Maya, a crab palisman, hops up to Boscha and becomes her staff.]

Boscha: [blushing] Okay. This is pretty cool.

Viney: I want to open my own veterinary clinic for mythical pets.

[A manticore palisman rises and becomes her staff.]

Viney: [gasps, chuckles] All right!

Gus: Dad wants me to become a master illusionist, but that's easy. So instead, I'll become an ambassador to the human realm and re-establish contact with the giraffes!

[A blue chameleon palisman climbs up to Gus and becomes his staff.]

Pufferfish Guy: I just want to make it to graduation.

[Puffeefish Guy then sees a sloth palisman hanging on his arm, which turns into his staff.]

Pufferfish Guy: [gasps, chuckles] Yes!

The Class: [murmurs] Oh wow!

[Everyone watches Luz as she takes her turn.]

Luz: I want to be a witch! [none of the Palismen approach her] Uh... probably just takes a little longer 'cause I'm a human, right?

Bat Queen: Palismen bond through emotion. I do not sense any conviction from you.

Luz: That's impossible. I'm Luz, I'm chock full of conviction!

Principal Bump: Perhaps specificity would help. There are many kinds of witches. What do you hope to accomplish with your magic?

Luz: Oh, uh... get home to my mom?

Gus: Would you still train to be a witch in the human realm?

Boscha: Can you even do magic there?

Luz: Huh, I guess I never thought that far ahead.

Eda: You okay, Luz?

[Cut to the Owl House at nighttime. Luz is pacing around her room.]

Luz: I stayed here because I wanted to learn magic, right? I wanted to be a witch like Eda and Azura. But what does that even mean? And I read stories like this. The main character always has to return home, and what? Did I expect to be a witch back in Connecticut? [groans] Mmm. Yeah, I wouldn't want to be my palisman either.

[Outside her door, Eda and King listen in, share a look and leave. Soon after, Flapjack hops out of Luz's bag.]

Luz: It's you! Did you come here for me?

[Flapjack hops around Luz's room.]

Luz: No. Of course not. Come on, little dude.

[Luz grabs her cape and runs out.]

[Cut to Hexside grudgby field. Luz stops in front of the palismen shelter, and touches the force shield covering it.]

Luz: How are we supposed to get through this?

[Flapjack presses against the force field, causing it to disappear.]

Luz: Ooh, palismen powers. Neat!

[Luz opens the door to let Flapjack in, waking all the other palismen inside.]

Luz: Aw. [closes the door] All right. I'm not leaving here until I figure out what my future is, and one of you becomes my palismen! What if... I use my powers to become a popular magician back in the human realm? No, I'm horrible at card tricks. What if... [picks up Flapjack] I stay on the Boiling Isles, and become a rugged bounty hunter? Nah, I'm too lovable. Oh! If I go back...

[Time passes. All the palismen are sleeping, and Luz laying is down with them. She yawns.]

Luz: [sleepily] What if... I open a magic pet shop, but it's password protected. The password is, "You're a little angel."

[Flapjack chrips back. Suddenly, the palismen shelter is lifted off the ground by something. Luz opens the door.]

Luz: Hey, we're a little busy in... here?

[Luz sees that they are no longer on ground and gasps. She looks up to see that an airship is carrying them. Cut to closeup of her shocked reaction. Cut to black.]

Luz: [to the palismen] I think we're being kidnapped!

[All the palismen start whimpering and shivering in fear.]

Luz: Don't worry. I'll figure this out.

[Luz uses a plant glyph to climb onto the airship, and sees the Golden Guard steering.]

Golden Guard: [whistling]

Luz: Ugh, him again.

[Luz sneaks up behind the Golden Guard, and slaps a fire glyph on his back.]

Luz: Hi-yah!

Golden Guard: Huh? [screams as he rockets off of the airship]

Luz: He'll be fine. Okay, how do I land this thing? Huh.

Golden Guard: Oh, you just pull that cord above your head.

Luz: Thank y--

[The Golden Guard has returned and is lying on the dashboard.]

Golden Guard: Hi.

[The Golden Guard fires a spell to tie Luz up with ropes, which knocks her off her feet.]

Luz: Wha- Hey!

Golden Guard: Good to see you too, human.

Luz: Why are you stealing palismen, Golden Guard?

Golden Guard: Frankly, [teleports over to Luz] You should be more concerned about yourself. For the crime of rocketing me off my own ship, you'll be locked in the dingiest cell in the Conformatorium, for the rest of your sad little life.

Luz: [scoffs] Whatever. I broke out of there like twice.

Golden Guard: Then we'll just zap you to dust and throw you into the sea. That better?

[Luz pouts and grumbles in response.]

Golden Guard: Good.

[The Golden Guard returns to steering the airship. Luz looks at the deck, which has scuff marks. Getting an idea, she starts drawing a glyph with her foot.]

Luz: Say, how did you get back on the ship so fast?

Golden Guard: Staff.

Luz: Cool.

[Luz activates the ice glyph, and it sends the Golden Guard's staff flying off the airship.]

Golden Guard: No!

[Luz chuckles, giving off a smug expression.]

Golden Guard: [chuckles] Human, it'll take more than that to thwart my mission.

[Suddenly, a hand dragon lands on the airship and roars.]

Luz: What is that?

[The dragon proceeds to rip the airship's balloon, causing Luz and the Golden Guard to fall from the sky. Luz and the Golden. Guard both scream as the airship crashes. Cut to black.]

[Cut to a shot of Luz regaining consciousness after the crash. Flapjack chrips as he pecks at the ropes tied around her.]

Luz: Huh? Little rascal?

[The ropes around Luz break, freeing her.]

Luz: Oh, thank you. [groans] My head!

[Luz finds the Golden Guard's staff, and grasps it in her hands. She hears him groaning, and sees his unconscious body nearby.]

Guard Captain: Kikimora, ma'am.

[Luz turns the other way when she overhears speaking.]

Guard Captain: We found the palismen. They seem rattled but unharmed.

[Luz peeks out behind a rock, watching Kikimora and the Guard Captain talk. Kikimora is holding the Golden Guard's helmet behind her back.]

Kikimora: Very good, Captain. Return to the city and prepare them for travel.

Guard Captain: Is it true, ma'am? Is the Golden Guard really...

Kikimora: [holds up the Golden Guard's helmet] This is all that remains.

Guard Captain: [gasps]

Kikimora: Such a horrible accident. [shakes head] Probably caused by the incompetent pilot.

Guard Captain: I'll... alert the castle. Scouts! To Latissa!

[The Guard Captain and the Coven scouts leave the scene. Once alone, Kikimora blows on a whistle, summoning the same dragon that caused the ship to crash.]

Kikimora: [pets her dragon] Excellent work, my pet.

Luz: [gasps]

Kikimora: [holds up the Golden Guard's helmet for her dragon] Now, find the rest of him and have yourself a nice little snack.

[Her dragon eats the Golden Guard's mask.]

Kikimora: I'll call for you soon.

[Kikimora leaves. Luz and Flapjack look back at the Golden Guard. Flapjack chrips.]

Luz: Don't worry. I won't leave him.

[Flapjack hops onto Luz's shoulder. They walk over to the unmasked Golden Guard. Cut to a closeup of his unmasked face.]

Luz: This is the Golden Guard?

[Cut to a shot of Luz looking down at him.]

Luz: It looks like he could be a student at Hexside.

[Luz slowly leans near the Golden Guard, then slaps hims in the face.]

Luz: Wake up!

Golden Guard: [jumps awake] Wha- you!

Luz: Shh! [puts hand over the Golden Guard's mouth to silence him] Listen. You are a bad person, and I do not like you. But Kikimora is trying to kill you and unfortunately, I'm too nice to let that happen!

[Luz removes her hand from his mouth in disgust, revealing that it is covered in slobber.]

Luz: Ugh, are you licking my hand? [puts her saliva covered hand in his face] I'm trying to help you!

Golden Guard: Why should I believe you? [puts hand in Luz's face]

Luz: Because... [grunts]

[They stop fighting when they hear Kikimora's dragon return. Her dragon spots the Golden Guard's cloak and devours it as Luz and the Golden Guard sneak away from the scene.]

[The duo walk to the town of Latissa, the Golden Guard taking the lead.]

Luz: Whew, man, Kikimora must hate you. Whoa! I haven't been outside Bonesborough that much, Latissa is so cool! Wait! Where are you going? Hey man, I just saved your life, the least you could do is tell me your name.

[The Golden Guard huffs at her, and goes over to Police Precinct 206. Luz gasps. The Golden Guard approaches scouts.]

Golden Guard: Scouts! Direct me to your communications room. I need to contact the castle immediately.

[The Golden Guard slides down his glove, showing the scouts his Emperor's Coven tattoo.]

Emperor's Coven Scout 1: Cute. I didn't know kids your age were still into temporary tattoos.

Emperor's Coven Scout 2: Yeah, show us your badge number.

Golden Guard: I am your superior, and I can prove it! [turns to Luz] Staff.

Luz: Hmm?

[Luz hides the staff behind her back.]

Emperor's Coven Scout 2: Isn't it a little late for you kids to be outside?

Emperor's Coven Scout 1: Yeah, go home before we call your parents.

[The Golden Guard glares angrily at Luz, and starts to chase her. Luz runs through townspeople.]

Luz: Uh, excuse me. Sorry.

[A cat yowls and hisses at them. The Golden Guard shoves it out of the way, making it fall down. Luz pushes down a garbage can, and the Golden Guard jumps over it. She leaps over a ledge, and falls on a set of stairs, spilling eyeballs out of one the monter's baskets.]

Luz: Sorry.

[Shortly after, the Golden Guard lands on his feet, and continues chasing her. Luz turns and runs down an alleyway. She stops and quickly begins to draw an ice glyph in the dirt. The Golden Guard arrives and runs towards her. She activates the ice glyph.]

Luz: Ice glyph!

[Luz launches herself onto the top of a building. She looks over the edge to see the Golden Guard standing, not doing anything.]

Luz: Come on, Golden Guard. Don't you know any, like, levitation spells?

[The Golden Guard glares at Luz, then looks away.]

Luz: [points at his staff] Are you powerless without this?

[The Golden Guard walks away. He then leaps onto different objects to get on top of the building. He then dodges Luz's energy beam attacks from his staff.]

Luz: Back up, or--or else!

Golden Guard: Or else what? [walks towards Luz] Gonna blast me to bits? [chuckles] Nah, you're too nice for that. Fly away? Uh-uh, you know you can't do that either. 'Cause then you'll be leaving behind your precious palismen. You don't tend to think things through, do you human?

[Luz bites her lip. Kikimora's dragon lands at Police Precinct 206.]

Golden Guard: So Kikimora was after my catch.

Luz: Seems like neither of us want her to win right now. So, let's work together to take back those palismen.

Golden Guard: Then what? You think I'll just let you walk away with them?

Luz: Maybe you won't have a choice! [spins the Golden Guard's staff around] I'm more formidable than you think. [almost drops it over the edge, but catches it]

Golden Guard: I doubt that, but fine. A truce till then.

Luz: [extends her hand] Truce!

[When the Golden Guard reaches to shake it, she takes her hand away.]

Luz: Too slow. [runs off chuckling]

[Cut to a shot of the Golden Guard's displeased reaction.]

Golden Guard: [grunts] Let's just get this over with...

[Cut to black. Return to the Golden Guard as he sneaks down to ground level to steal something in a bag. He climbs back up the building and sees Luz drawing two connected glyphs.]

Golden Guard: Huh, I've never seen magic like this. What will it do?

Luz: Well, we don't want to spook Kikimora's steed, because it might drop the nest and hurt the palismen! So, using these fire and ice spells, I can command the glyphs to produce a thick mist!

Golden Guard: And the sleeping nettles?

Luz: They're essential! Combined with the magic mist, it'll create-

Golden Guard: A sleep-inducing smoke, forcing Kikimora to land.

[Luz looks at him surprised.]

Golden Guard: Oh, um, I-- I-I read a similar spell in Bones to Earth-

Luz: -A Study of Wild Magic! Eda once pickpocketed the guy who wrote it.

Golden Guard: I've never seen glyphs before, but, it seems very similar to the elemental magic practiced in the Savage Ages.

Luz: Really?

Golden Guard: Actually, not many people know this, but... [stops] No. No, no, no, no. This stuff is restricted for a reason. You should forget about it before you're hurt.

Luz: Uh huh... Other than Lilith, I've never spoken to someone inside the Emperor's Coven. What made you want to join?

Golden Guard: [sighs, leans against the wall] You were right before. I'm a powerless witch. A lot of my ancestors were. I never thought I'd have a future in a world like this. But then, Belos found me and gave me a staff with artificial magic. He said the Titan had big plans for me.

Luz: At least you have your future figured out now.

Golden Guard: At least you can figure out your own.

[Flapjack hops toward him and pecks his leg.]

Golden Guard: Hey! Stop, get away from me!

Luz: He's just being friendly.

Golden Guard: I don't care! These things are made from wild magic. It's dangerous.

Luz: And does he look dangerous to you?

[Kikimora's dragon flies into the air.]

Luz: Masks on.

[Luz and the Golden Guard both put on their masks.]

Luz: Once they're surrounded by the smoke, we'll need to stay close to see where they land.

[The Golden Guard nods. Luz offers the staff back to the Golden Guard.]

Golden Guard: Are you sure?

Luz: Just take it!

[Kikimora's dragon flies overhead. Luz activates the connected glyphs. After, she gets on the Golden Guard's staff, to go after the dragon. Kikimora and her dragon both get sleepy.]

Golden Guard: I think it's working.

[Luz activates a light glyph to lead Kikimora in their direction.]

Kikimora: Stop!

[Kikimora's dragon crashes onto the ground and falls asleep. Kikimora herself is thrown off the saddle and lands on the ground. Luz and the Golden Guard land.]

Luz: The palismen!

[Luz runs toward the palismen to check on them.]

Luz: Hello, babies. Aw, you guys must be so cold and scared. Here, [takes off her cap] make sure you share. Now, stay in here, okay? We'll get you home safe and-

[The Golden Guard points his staff at Luz.]

Luz: [nervous chuckle] Right, I didn't think this through. Again.

[Luz shuts the palismen shelter's door and stands, staring at the Golden Guard, upset.]

Luz: So you're really gonna do this? You're just gonna hand all these innocent little guys over to Belos? I know what he does with them. I thought you might've been a good guy. But I guess that was just wishful thinking. You're not my friend, you're just the Golden Guard.

[After a moment, the Golden Guard shows signs of wavering before taking his mask off.]

Golden Guard: My name is Hunter.

[Luz gasps. At that moment, Hunter's hit by an energy bolt fired by a drowsy Kikimora.]

Kikimora: I can't tell who's there, but I know I've got you! [keeps shooting magic at them]

[Hunter defends Luz from another energy bolt. He and Kikimora fight. Her whistle falls off her neck during the fight. Luz picks up the whistle, and Kikimora attempts to fire at her again, but Hunter shoves her back.]

Kikimora: This is treason against a Coven official!

[Cut to Kikimora's blurry POV shot. Hunter pats out the tiny flame in his forelock.]

Kikimora: I will have your head!

[Kikimora continues firing magic at Hunter, who keeps deflecting her attacks. In the background, Luz run over to Kikimora's dragon and gets on them.]

Luz: Hey... [chuckles] ...good thingy. The Boiling Isles will never stop surprising me.

[Luz blows the whistle, waking the dragon. It flies into the night sky. Hunter deflects another attacked from Kikimora, which knocks her unconscious. Hunter looks up at Luz and the dragon. Luz looks back before turning around, disappointment on her face.]

[Cut to morning at the grudgby field. The Bat Queen lands on the field.]

Principal Bump: Good morning, Bat Queen. The palismen are all accounted for. Although, I don't know where that thing came from...

[Principal Bump points to Kikimora's dragon, sleeping. Flapjack chirps and hops up to the Bat Queen.]

Bat Queen: You found someone after all this time? Go then.

[Flapjack flies off.]

[Cut to the Owl House, where Luz collapses onto her sleeping bag and looks at a framed photo of her with her mom.]

Luz: [sighs] Everyone got one except me, huh? Maybe I wasn't meant to be here. [she turns her head only to turn it back when light shines from her window finding...] Eda!

[Eda is perched on her windowsill sporting a massive proud smile on her face.]

Eda: I'd thought I'd find you here.

King: [climbs in] We could've used the door!

Luz: What did you get into?

[Eda tosses a small log to her.]

Luz: [confused] Whew. Uh, how... thoughtful?

Eda: It's palistrom wood, ya ding-dong!

King: Now you can make your own palismen!

Luz: But-- But how? Isn't this super rare?

Eda: Let's just say that the Bonesborough Garden Club--

King: Was robbed! By us!

[Eda gives Luz a thumbs up.]

Luz: I don't know what to say...

Eda: [puts hand on Luz's shoulder] No pressure, but whenever you know what you want, we'll start carving.

Luz: If it's okay, I'd like some time to think. It's hard to picture my future without seeing my mom.

Eda: Eh, there's no rush. Just know that whatever you need from us, we gotcha.

Luz: [smiles] Thanks.

[Luz puts the wood in her summer camp bag.]

[Cut to Hunter kneeling in the Emperor's throne room. He's back in uniform but lacks his helmet.]

Emperor Belos: So, you return with nothing. [stands] Is this the thanks I get for taking you in?

Hunter: Of course not. I want to help. A-A-And if you told me how wild magic did this to you, I might be able to find a--

[Belos aims a sharp spike that barely misses Hunter's ear.]

Hunter: My apologies. I spoke out of turn. It won't happen again.

Emperor Belos: [clutches his chest] These outbursts are painful [his eyes glow blue] and so is watching you fail. I know you can do better, Hunter.

[Outside, Kikimora is approaching the doors to the room when Hunter steps out, causing her to stop.]

Kikimora: [gasps] Golden Guard? Y-You're alive! I mean, I heard about the crash in Latissa.

Hunter: Luckily, some travelers picked me up out of the wreckage. So I'm actually doing great. Looks like you had a rough night though.

[Kikimora seethes, but notices Hunter's singed hair: realizing he was her attacker, she glares at him. Cut to Hunter's room. He walks over to his bed and lies down.]

Hunter: I can help, if I just knew a little more...

[Flapjack chirps. Hunter sits up and sees Flapjack at the windowsil.]

Hunter: Palisman! [clutches Flapjack]

[Hunter squeezes him, Flapjack chrips. Hunter then lets him go.]

Hunter: Oh! Sorry. [frowns, pets Flapjack] You shouldn't be here. It'd be bad if Belos saw you.

[Flapjack into a staff, which falls into Hunter's hands.]

Hunter: Oh! I was not expecting that.

[Hunter walks over to the window with his new staff, and gazes longingly.]
