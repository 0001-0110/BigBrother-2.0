[Open on King and Luz standing in the living room of the Owl House in front of an easel with a box of crayons on it.]

King: How do you draw so good, Luz?

Luz: I'm glad you asked that question, King. Drawing can be fun once you know a few tricks. [starts drawing King] I like to break characters down into simple shapes. Here's you, [flips paper up] and Eda is made of these shapes. [flips paper again to a blank page] Hooty is really easy. [draws Hooty] He's just a circle and a tube.

King: So realistic!

Hooty: [rolls into frame] Hey! What are you guys up to?

[Camera switches between Hooty, shocked, and Luz's drawing of him.]

Luz: [voiceover] Hooty?

Hooty: [hisses as his feathers stick up]

King: Hooty, no! It's just a drawing.

Hooty: Who are you? This is my territory! Ah! [rips the paper]

Luz: [attempting to restrain him] Hooty, stop!

[Cut to Hooty "sitting" on the couch, next to drawings of Luz and King.]

Hooty: Thanks for calming me down back there, guys. I can get a little territorial.

[Cut to King and Luz peeking at him from around a doorframe.]

King: Hooty's been talking to those drawings of us for, like, seven hours.

Luz: That's the magic of drawing with good proportions. It makes things look real.

Hooty: [looking at the real King and Luz] Wait a minute. Who are you? I'm freaking out!

[King and Luz slowly retreat behind the doorframe and out of view.]
