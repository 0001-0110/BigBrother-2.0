[Open on Gus sitting in the hallways of Hexside, his head buried in his arms. Luz walks up to him.]
Luz: Hey, Gus. You okay?
Gus: I-I messed up bad, Luz. Willow just needed help with this pixie problem, right? So I thought, oh, that I'll lure them away with an illusion. But then...
Luz: That angered the pixies, and they attacked Willow. I heard.
Gus: I moved up two grades. What's the point of being good at this if I can't do anything good with it?
Luz: It was an honest mistake. Besides, Willow's tough as nails. I'm sure you'll both be feeling better tomorrow.
[Cut to Gus laying on the floor of his bedroom, presumably tomorrow.]
Gus: [groans]
-THEME SONG-
[Camera shows off Gus's bedroom.]
Crystal Ball: [caws and beeps]
[The crystal ball shows a prerecorded message of King.]
King: [on recording] I'm not reading this.
Gus: [on recording, off screen] Come on, King. Please?
King: Ugh, fine. [clears throat] Is that a six-footed pig or a floating appendage? Why, no! [Gus, wearing a cape, hops on screen.] It's Gus the Illusion Master. Please leave a message.
[The video turns to Willow, her arm in a cast.]
Willow: [on recording] Hey, Gus. Thanks for sending me all those "Get well soon" illusions but, uh...
[Three tiny illusions of Gus jump onto her shoulders and head.]
Illusion Gus #1: Willow! How are you feeling? Do you have a fever?
Illusion Gus #2: Willow, you want me to sing for you? Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...
Illusion Gus #3: Willow, is this helping?
Willow: Can you please take them back?
Gus: [groans]
[The crystal ball shuts off. Gus rolls onto his stomach and traces a spell circle, summoning his illusion to stand in front of him.]
Illusion Gus #1: Where's Willow?
Illusion Gus #2: Why are we here?
Illusion Gus #3: Did we do bad?
[Gus blows the illusions away. Someone knocks on a door. Cut to Gus opening the front door to find Luz.]
Luz: [raises fists] Gustopher! [finger points] Gusteban! [leans on the doorframe] Augustabeth! Any of those working for you?
Gus: You need my library card to visit Amity, don't you?
Luz: [laughs self-consciously] I haven't been doing a good job of hiding that, huh?
[Gus shakes his head.]
Luz: Well, I was also hoping to do a little bit of... research! Come on! [drags Gus away]
Gus: [screams]
[Cut to Luz and Gus walking through the streets of Bonesborough.]
Luz: So, Eda's mom told me I'm not the first human to have lived in Bonesborough. If that's true, there might be some info on how they got here in the library!
Gus: Yeah, okay. Looking through old newspapers is about all I'm good for anyway.
[The two of them stop walking.]
Luz: Spill it, Gustonimo. Are you okay?
Gus: I-I've just been thinking. What if it's time for me to explore different kinds of magic?
Luz: I'm all for trying new things, but what's wrong with illusions?
Gus: Illusions are just so...you know--
Slitherbeast: [growling]
Braxas: Yay! Huh?
Bria: Good work guys!
Gavin: Yeah!
Angmar: Alright!
Gus: [gasps]
Warden Wrath: [picks up Braxas] Son, are you okay?
Braxas: Yes, Daddy. Thank you, mysterious heroes!
Bria: Stay safe out there!
Gus: Wow! Just wow! Plants. Abomination. Construction. You guys took down that Slitherbeast like it was nothing.
Bria: Nah, it wasn't that easy.
Gavin: Yeah, looked like you had a real hard time out there.
Gus: You're Glandus students, right? I go to Hexside. Name's Gus.
Bria: Nice to meet ya. This is Angmar. Gavin.
Gavin: Hey!
Bria: And I'm--
Mattholomule: Bria! [panting, running on screen] I would've helped, but like, there was this other baby in danger. You probably couldn't see.
Gus: Mattholomule?
Mattholomule: Augustus? Back off, twerp! This operation is Glandus kids only.
Bria: Hey, Matty, it's all cool. Did you get the map?
Mattholomule: Yes! And I only had to endue 35 noogies from my older brother.
Bria: Nice work!
Gus: Well, uh, I can see you guys are busy, so--
Bria: Wait. Have you ever heard of the Galdorstones?
Gavin: They're powerful relics. Many witches and demons have sought them.
Angmar: But they've all returned empty-handed, haunted by its guardian. Until us!
Bria: We heard some coven scouts talking about them, but it'll be rough going. You said you are a Hexside student, right? We could use the extra strength.
Gus: That sounds awesome, but I can't. I promised a friend I'd help her with something today.
[On cue, Luz turns visible between everyone, surprising them.]
Luz: [gasps]
All: Whoa!
Luz: [pants] Gus, you ran away so fast, but I didn't wanna interrupt so...I think you should go.
Mattholomule: Well, he can't. Gus is just an illusionist. He'll only hold us back.
Luz: Hah! Shows what you know. Gus here is a regular super witch.
Gus: Luz! [drags her to the side] I see what you're doing and it's really sweet, but I don't actually know any spells besides illusions.
Luz: No problem. [hands him some spell glyphs] Come on, man. You know I'm all about proving jerks wrong.
Gus: Alright. I'm in. Where do we find these Galdorstones?
Bria: We're journeying to the Looking Glass Ruins in the Forearm Forest!
Mattholomule: What's wrong, Augustus? Scared?
Bria: We all are. Who knows what awaits us out there? But we all got each other's back, right?
Gus: Yeah, um-Yeah. Yeah, alright, let's go!
All: Woo!
Mattholomule: [sarcastically] Woo.
[Cut to the Bonesborough Library. Luz is at a desk with a crystal ball.]
Hexside Student: [laughs] Did you check out the other volume?
[Luz types "human" into the crystal ball's search bar. She finds an article about Eda using paddleballs that were mistaken for weapons.]
Luz: "Mystery vendor floods market with dangerous human goods." Oh, Eda. "Human resident donates personal diary to library." [gasps] Yes! This must be it!
[Cut to the Kid's Corner. Luz peeks in, watching Amity, her hair down, talk to one of the baby class kids, who is holding her hairband captive.]
Amity: Come on. Give it back.
Baby Class Kid: No!
Amity: [sighs] If you give me back my hairband, I'll read you whatever book you want tomorrow.
Baby Class Kid: [gasps, hands the hairband back] Finally! I can learn how to summon the dark lord!
[Amity stands and ties her hair up. Luz looks at her in complete adoration.]
Edric and Emira: Hey, Luz.
Luz: Oh! [chuckles] Hey, Ed. Hey, Em. Picking up Amity?
Emira: Nah, looks like you got that covered.
Edric: I'm looking for skincare tips. I have a date tonight.
Emira: Yeah, he needs all the help he can get, after he accidentally texted a poem to their mom.
Edric: Please don't tell people that.
Amity: [walking up to them] Are they bothering you again?
Luz: Oh! [steadily blushing] No, I just came here to see you, and, uh, here you are. [chuckles]
[Amity is also blushing, and neither of them can look at the other.]
Edric and Emira: [gasp, put two and two together and share a smile]
Emira: Edric, your face, it's exploding with horrific pustules!
Edric: Oh, no. [genuinely worried] Wait. Is it really?
Emira: We have to fix it before your date or you'll get dumped!
Edric: What? I will?
Emira: [annoyed] Come on, Ed.
[Emira drags him away. Luz looks at Amity.]
Luz: I was actually wondering if you could help me find this book? [hands her a notebook] Hundreds of years ago, there was a human named Philip Wittebane living in Bonesborough. And he donated his diary to this library.
Amity: And this might tell you how to travel between realms, right?
Luz: Yes! My mom probably thinks I'm missing right now. I have to get back to her as soon as possible.
Amity: Well, something this old would be kept in... the Forbidden Stacks.
[Cut to the two of them standing in front of towering doors reading "The Forbidden Stacks." An echo mouse runs past the girls and under the door.]
Echo Mouse: [squeaks]
Luz: Ah!
Amity: Only Malphas, the master librarian, is allowed in here.
Luz: No te preocupes. Todo va a salir bien. Like my mom always said. [chuckles, looks away] I'm sure I can find another way.
Amity: Hey, wait. I never said I wasn't gonna help. My staff card should be able to open those doors. But once we're inside, you have to listen to everything I say. If we're caught, I could lose my job.
Luz: [grabs Amity's hand in both of hers] You won't lose your job. I promise.
[They both look at their hands and blush. Luz immediately retracts her hands as Amity turns around.]
Amity: Well, let's not waste any time.
[She uses her card to open the door and sharing looks of determination, they head in as the doors close behind them.]
[Cut to a forest, where the Glandus kids and Gus are walking.]
Bria: This will be a breeze once we get the Galdorstones.
Gus: What can the Galdorstones actually do?
Mattholomule: If you're holding one, every spell you cast gets a big power boost!
Angmar: I can grow an entire forest, and make my own butterfly sanctuary!
Gavin: I can create the biggest Abomination ever! [bitterly] I bet Dad will pay attention to that.
Gus: Whoa.
Mattholomule: Sorry. Doesn't do squat for illusions. Can't enhance what's not actually there.
Gus: Pfft. I know that.
Bria: Hold up, guys. We've come to our first challenge.
[Their path is blocked by thick brambles.]
Mattholomule: Show us what you got, Augustus. What did the human call you? "A super witch"? [chuckles]
Bria: [gasps] That's a great idea! Go on, Gus. I know you can do it.
Gus: [pulls a glyph out from under his collar; groans] Which one is this? [draws spell circle] Fireball!
[It is indeed a fire glyph. A massive fireball clears their path.]
Bria: Wow, Gus!
All: Woo-hoo!
Bria: I knew it was a good idea to bring you!
Mattholomule: I don't know what's going on, but I've got my eyes on you.
[Cut to the library.]
Luz: How much further do we have to go?
Amity: Actually, we're here.
Luz: Whoa. Let's get lookin'.
Amity: [gasps, pulls Luz down] Wait.
[Malphas enters from a doorway. Luz and Amity realize how close they are to each other and roll away, blushing.]
Luz: So, we'll be super sneaky and quiet. Got it.
Amity: Malphas is actually the one who gave me my job and my own study room. He's usually nice, but if we're caught, he'd feed us to the book worms.
Luz: I know here that probably means unholy, blood-sucking snake monster, but in the Human Realm, that's just a cute name for nerds.
Amity: [still blushing] Huh. The human world sounds odd.
Luz: Maybe it would be less odd if I showed you around someday. But, uh, let's turn back. I don't wanna push you.
Amity: We're getting that diary. [drags Luz deeper into the library]
Luz: Wooh!
[Cut back to the forest.]
Mattholomule: According to the map, we should be getting close. [screams as a snake drags him by the ankles into a tree]
Gus: Don't worry, Matty. I got ya. [uses plant glyph]
Mattholomule: Hey! Only Bria can call me-- [screams, face plants on the ground]
[Gavin and Angmar pick Mattholomule up by the arms and drag him off.]
Gavin: Come on, dude.
Angmar: I'm not surprised he couldn't handle Glandus.
Gus: What did they mean by "couldn't handle Glandus"?
Bria: Things work differently at Glandus. Weak students are pushed around by the strong. But if I had a Galdorstone, I might be able to change things for the better.
Angmar: Hey! Over here!
Bria: [gasps] Okay, Angmar, you're on lookout duty. Angmar!
Angmar: Hmm?
Bria: I said you're on lookout duty. And if I catch you playing with anymore bugs, I'll make you eat them! Okay?
Angmar: [whimpers]
Bria: I believe in you!
Mattholomule: I can't believe we found it.
Bria: [gasps; uses magic to get a Galdorstone and cracks a statue in the process] Oh. Whoops. Well, we did it everyone. The power of the Galdorstones is ours! [squeals] I can't believe it. The legends were true! Woo-hoo!
[As Bria, Gavin, and Mattholomule go around stealing the Galdorstones, Gus moves aside the plants covering the bases of the statues.]
Gus: Huh. "The Phantom Bringer." "Aleth the Vision Creator"? "Khari the Mirage Maker." But these titles are for-- [gasps] Oh no. Stop! These aren't ruins. This is an illusionist graveyard.
Mattholomule: [drops the Galdorstone he's holding] Ew!
Bria: [giggles] Aw, Gus, you're saying that as if it's a bad thing.
Gus: What? Of course it is. These stones were theirs. We shouldn't take them.
Bria: Even if these witches were alive, what would illusionists use Galdorstones for? High-def party tricks? Come on, Gus. Don't you wanna power up those cool spells of yours?
Gus: No. This isn't right. I won't let you steal these.
Bria: I don't think you know what you're saying, Gus.
Angmar: [runs in] It's real! The guardian is real! And it's coming this way!
All: [screaming]
Guardian: [roars]
Angmar: I heard it has the power to control weather.
Gavin: And summon ghosts.
Bria: Well, I wonder if it can handle a little fire.
[She shoves Gus into the open. He reaches for a glyph, and then pats himself down.]
Gus: I'm all out of glyphs! [gasps]
[Cut to the library, where Luz and Amity are pulling books off of shelves in hopes to find Philip's diary.]
Echo Mouse: [squeaking]
Amity: Hmm?
Luz: [gasps] [pulls out Philip's diary, squeals]
Both: [ggigle] Shh, shh, shh.
[Luz opens the diary. An echo mouse is sitting in the pages, having eaten nearly all of them.]
Luz: [gasps] You little rat! ["rat" echoes] Oh, no.
Malphas: Amity?
[Cut to the steps of the library, the girls standing before Malphas who isn't as intimidating as he appeared.]
Malphas: I'm just like super disappointed in you. Like, I can't even process these feelings right now. Gosh, it's so hard for me to say this, but like, you're fired.
[Amity tenses as Malphas magically takes her employee ID. The doors close heavily. Luz and Amity stare at them.]
Luz: Amity, I am so--
Amity: Not right now, Luz. [tearing up] Everything's changed since you came here. Being around you, it makes me do stupid things and I wish it didn't. [gasps]
Luz: [also tearing up, nearly crying] It's okay. I, uh-- [sniffles] I do stupid things around you too, Amity.
Amity: [gasps] I think I need to go home. [leaves]
Luz: [cries, takes breath and slicks hair back] Nada funcionará a menos que lo haga funcionar.
[She squares her shoulders and walks back into the library. Cut to the Looking Glass Ruins.]
Guardian: [roars]
Gus: [being knocked over] Whoa-!!
Guardian: [roars]
Gus: Uh, It'll just be an illusion, but maybe I can scare him away.
Illusion Guardian: [roars and then poofs]
Keeper: Oh-ho! I am the keeper of the Looking Glass Graveyard, and it has been a very long time since I've had a visitor! And to think it'd be another illusionist! Hehehehehe, though I don't remember them being so small.
[Gus gives him a face.]
Keeper: Don't give me that face, an illusionist has always kept watch over the Galdorstones, We gain no powers from them, so we're the least likely to use them for evil. Probably.
Gus: Well, we gotta get out of here. Now.
Bria: So, the big bag guardian is just another useless illusionist. Hehehe, today just keeps getting better.
[Cut to black. Resumes on the Keeper and Gus making various noises while being trapped by an abomination and some vines.]
Bria: [getting some Galdorstones] Got it! Whoops.
Angmar and Gavin: Oh!
Mattholomule: [picking up a Galderstone] Huh. Hey!!!
Bria: You're playing by Glandus rules, Matty. You can have anything you want if you're strong enough to take it.
Bria, Gavin and Angmar: [laughing]
Mattholomule: [to Gus] Hey. I-I didn't know she was gonna do this.
Bria: [offscreen] Matty, we need you to hold our stuff!
Mattholomule: This is exactly how it was at Glandus. Always Bria's stooge.
Gus: Better a stooge than a clown. Bria was right, illusions are nothing but high-def party tricks.
Mattholomule: Yeah, I used to think that too. [He makes a saw of rock to cut the vines trapping Gus and The Keeper.] But then I met some dork who used his powers to save me from a man-eating detention pit. All I'm saying is, if a dumb illusion can save a jerk like me, maybe it's not as useless as you think.
Gus: Thanks, Mattholomule. It's time to teach those jerks a lesson!
Keeper: I agree. I'll call the hounds.
Mattholomule: [slightly unsettled] Whoa.
Gus: With all due respect, sir, I'd like to try something a little more... creative.
Angmar: Intercepted!
[A statue crumbles due to Angmar throwing himself straight at it.]
Bria, Gavin, and Angmar: [laughing]
Angmar: [notices a pink butterfly-looking creature] Huh?
Bria: Maybe we can sell the small ones to the Emperor's Coven, and keep the rest for ourselves! Angmar, start collecting! ...Angmar?
[Angmar is off following the butterfly.]
Bria: Hey! Get back here!
Butterfly: tehehehe, wink. [continues giggling as it flies off into the fog]
Angmar: [following it] Wait- come back! What species are you?
Bria: Ugh, whatever. I never really liked him anyway. Looks like you're my second in command, Gav-
Gavin: D-Dad?
[A clone of Gavin with a big mustache appears from the fog.]
"Gavin's Dad": Gavin, I just want you to know that I'm proud of you. Now, how about we go get some ice cream, son?
Gavin: Huh! That sounds great, Pops! Wait, when did you grow a mustache?
"Gavin's Dad": Hey! Don't blow this chance.
[Gavin and his "dad" walk off into the fog together.]
Bria: Come out, illusionist! I'm not dumb enough to fall for these tricks.
[The world around her turns black, a shadowy figure in the shape of Gus runs across the screen.]
Bria: Rghhaah!!! [makes a pillar from the ground, breaking the illusion] That's right. Who's strong now!? I never needed those losers anyway. [picks up the bag of Galdorstones] oofh- More for me.
[The graveyard's statues turn to face her. Their eyes and mouths are bleeding, there's a statue around her size dragging itself to her from the ground.]
Bria: Haha, cute. [draws spell circle, which does nothing] Huh? [tries again] Why isn't my magic working?!
[She yelps as her hands seem to turn to stone and break off. The statue on the ground is getting closer and closer as she backs away.]
Bria: [panicking] What's going on? No, no. This is all just an illusion. Hahah, it can't actually hurt me. It can't even touch me!
[It touches her.]
Bria: [gasps]
[The statue looks at her, its face matching her own. Blood pours from the statue's eyes.]
Bria: AAH! Cursed! This place is cursed! [runs off, screaming]
[The illusion that was set over the entire graveyard ends, revealing a slightly tired looking Gus where the moving statue was.]
Gus: Man, that took a lot of concentration.
[The illusons disappears, revealing several rock pillars Bria had conjured. Mattholomule and the Keeper come out of hiding.]
Keeper: Laying an illusion over the whole graveyard to make it seem like the stones weren't working, very clever. Keeping honing your powers of observation, child, and there's no limit to what you'll be able to do.
Gus: There are some limits. I wish I could repair all the damage they did.
Mattholomule: Um... maybe I can help?
[A bird chirps, standing on a statue. They've been repaired, though not nearly to their former glory.]
Keeper: Thank you for defending the Looking Glass Graveyard, witchlings. Perhaps it's time I hid this place for good.
Gus: But- there's so much history here!
Mattholomule: What if we came over on the weekend to help build your defenses?
Keeper: I would like that very much. You're both welcome to come whenever you please. [he makes finger guns and leaves]
Mattholomule: He is definitely a ghost.
Gus: So, does that mean we're like... friends now?
Mattholomule: I... don't know.
[They both start leaving the graveyard.]
Mattholomule: [playfully shoves Gus] Squirt. Heheh
Gus: [playfully shoves back] Jerk. Hehahah
[Fade to Amity's room, where Edric is admiring himself in the mirror while Emira brushes Amity's hair.]
Amity: Ever since Luz came here, things have just gotten confusing. I'm thinking things I've never thought before. I'm feeling things I never used to feel!
Emira: Is that so bad? You weren't happy before- Ed, don't pick, You'll make it worse.
Edric: Too late.
Amity: [sigh]
Emira: Hey, your roots are growing out. Do you wanna dye your hair again?
[Emira holds up a bottle of green hair dye. Amity grabs a strand of her hair contemplatively.]
[Cut to a short time later. Luz is walking up to the front door of Blight Manor. Amity, with only the top of the back of head showing, revealing her hair to now be lavender, looks at her siblings, Emira holding a pair of scissors.]
Amity: So, how's it look?
Edric: Looks like you're about to get in big trouble with Mom. [Emira lightly hits him] Ow.
Emira: I think it looks great. But, yeah, maybe don't tell her I helped. [hides the scissors behind her back]
[Knocking comes from the door. Amity opens it. Luz is there with Amity's staff card and looks very disheveled.]
Luz: I'm sorry about everything! I understand if you never wanna see me again. Uh--
[She and the camera fully see Amity's new hair for the first time: it's lavender, she no longer has it tied up and has bangs.]
Luz: It's different.
Amity: Oh yeah. Mom always liked it green. I thought I could use a change... u-uh, [takes employee ID] how'd you get this back? And, what happened?
Luz: [shakes a vine off her arm] Well, to convince Malphas to hire you again, I had to go through some trials. And categorize some man-eating books- and, tame something called a paper dragon? That guy was not fun. [notices Edric and Emira] Oh, hey, guys.
Amity: Hm?
[She turns around. The twins duck around the corner. Amity sighs and goes outside, closing the door behind her.]
Amity: Oh- looks like you made a new friend.
Luz: Agh- [shakes leg, getting the echo mouse on her leg to scurry off of it] You're the one who ate the diary! Uaagh!! [jumps after it, catching it but landing on her face] I hate you.
Amity: [giggles] Wait, This is an echo mouse. It consumes knowledge through writing and can play back anything it eats. We dealt with them a lot at work. Watch.
[Amity rubs its head a bit. The echo mouse's eyes eyes light up as it projects illustrations onto the front door.]
Philip Wittebane: [voiceover] My journey through the Demon Realm is far from over. But today I humbly donate my journal to the ages. Entry one: May 21st... I think. My name is Philip Wittebane, and I found myself in a world so horrid, yet so fantastic, few minds could have dreamt it. If only those at home could see what I have, and perhaps they shall. For the more I learn about this realm, the more I am certain I can harness its strange powers to return home. Today I begin recording my journey to create a portal back to the Human Realm.
[The projection stops. Luz holds up the echo mouse.]
Luz: Thank you, little mouse. I hope you and I can become good friends.
[Luz boops the mouse's nose with her own. The wind gently blows her hair around. Amity stares between Luz and the damaged ID in her hand. She smiles.]
Amity: Don't worry, you always have a way of sneaking into people's hearts.
[She kisses Luz on the cheek. Both of them look surprised by what she did.]
Edric: [from an open window with Emira] Bold move, sister.
[Luz and Amity make eye contact, both gasping softly. Amity blushes furiously and steps away.]
Amity: Uh- okay- good to see you! Farewell forever. [walks inside, muttering to herself:] Why did I do that? Why'd I do that? Why did I do that?
[Luz stands there for a second before collapsing to her knees, still facing where Amity once was.]
