[Open on Eda's Human Collectibles stand. She is dusting the table, looking bored, while Luz is reading the first Azura book to King. Cut to the pages of the book, showing Azura facing off against Hecate.]

Luz: Emboldened by the dishonor Hecate had shown, Azura lifted her staff to the cotton-candy skies and shouted, "I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!" And look! I drew a flip book. [flips between two pages] Pew, pew, pew!

King: Show me the picture. [peeking over the top of the book]

Luz: What?

King: Show me the picture! [Luz does] Hah! I can draw better than that. You know, they once called me the King of Artists.

Luz: Wait. I thought you were the King of Demons. Are you just making this up now?

King: Doesn't matter. What's important is that my followers would leave me offerings in fear of me!

Luz: Well, I can offer you more of this tantalizing book.

Eda: Ugh! Please stop reading that. Its flowery language is an insult to witches and driving away all of our serious customers!

Luz: Um, Eda? [zoom out to the empty street] What customers? There aren't even any other stands around. What's going on?

Eda: This is a bad omen. There must be something horrible happening today.

Gus: Luz! [him and Willow run up to the stand] Something amazing is happening today!

Luz: Gus, Willow! Hey!

Willow: [holds up a flier] It's the annual covention! Student witches get to see all the types of covens before they're placed in one. There's even a mystery guest this year!

Luz: A job fair for witches! Eda, can we go?

Eda: Absolutely not.

Luz: [groans, drops to the ground]

Eda: I never joined a coven for a reason. Sure it's like a fun club for witches, but you're also giving up your magical independence to be part of a crooked system.

Willow: Mmm. [drops the flier]

Eda: Eh, but, you know, no judgment. In any case, I haven't been to one since we were girls.

Luz: "We"?

Eda: I-- the-- I mean--

Luz: [pops back up] Who's "we"? You have a mysterious past! Now we gotta go!

Eda: No.

Luz: Okay. Then you leave me no choice.

King: [grabs the book] "You shall not shan't doeth no more harm," Azura callethed out... [continues reading]

Eda: So flowery, so awful.

[Eda walks away, opening the Portal Door and stepping through it.]

King: "Hecate could only screech, screech as did she, for the screeching did worseneth."

[Luz tosses King through the Portal as it closes. It opens a second later, Eda coming back through with King sitting on her head.]

Eda: Stop it! Stop it! I will literally do anything to stop this!

[Cut to a long building, a sign in front of it reading "COVENTION TODAY alchemists anonymous tomorrow". Cut to the front of the building, where Luz is bouncing on her feet and Willow is clapping.]

Eda: [groans into her hand]

-THEME SONG-

Eda: [grunting as she struggles to pull her hood on, King hanging off of it] Gotta keep a low profile.

Luz: [grunts as she tries to shove Eda's hair in the cowl] Is this cowl really necessary?

Eda: Do you think all my wanted posters are for petty theft? [numerous small objects fall out of her hair] Partly. [scoops the things back into her cowl] But the big whammy is I disobeyed the law and refused to join a coven. If I'm seen, I could go to jail. Again.

Willow: [approaching with one of Eda's wanted posters] Maybe this informative event will inspire you to join a coven.

[Eda traces a spell that pulls Willow's cowl over her face.]

Eda: Let's just get this over with.

[They enter the building.]

Luz: Whoa. Was I even alive before now?

[Several booths are set up inside, each with a sign for one coven or another. From the ceiling hangs nine large colorful banners. Two student witches fly by on broomsticks.]

Gus: Those are the main nine covens, but there are hundreds of other ones you can join.

Willow: [as they're all walking] There's Flower Coven, Artist Coven, Big Dog Coven, Small Cat Coven, Tiniest Cat Coven--

Eda: [groans]

Willow: Also the Grumpy Coven.

Eda: What was that?

[Willow yips as the kids and King all run.]

Man #1: Uh, excuse me, ma'am, but you look rather familiar. [looks between Eda's wanted posters and her]

Eda: Uh... No, I don't. Distraction spell!

[She reaches into her cowl and throws a bag on the ground. It's Hex Mix, which does nothing. Eda runs away anyway, but returns when the man bends down to grab it. She drags his hood over his face, scoops up the Hex Mix, and runs away again. Cut back to the kids as Eda rejoins them.]

Luz: [stops and points] Ooh, what's that?

Willow: That's the Construction Coven.

[Cut to a bearded witch in a hard hat and Tiny Nose standing next to a pallet of wood and a pallet of bricks. The witch grabs both pallets from the bottom and tosses them in the air. The materials fall down to perfectly construct a small house.]

Willow: One of the main nine. They use power glyphs to increase their strength.

[The witch removes his hard hat to pull of a power glyph from a stack atop his head. He peels the adhesive off the back of one and puts it on Tiny Nose's nose. Her pupils constrict.]

Tiny Nose: [screams and picks up the witch, throwing him in the air] Ha-a-a! I'm the destroyer of worlds! [grabs the Construction Coven sign and tosses it]

Man #2: Hey, that's the opposite of construction!

[Two witches run in to stop Tiny Nose as she grabs a giant hammer. Cut back to Luz.]

Luz: Yowza-wowza!

[A light blue double of Luz ducks out from behind her.]

Illusion Luz: Yowza-wowza!

Luz: Yowza-wha-a-a?

[Her illusion double walks over to two Illusion track witches. It waves at her and disappears.]

Gus: [runs over to the other witches] Ah! You've been taken in by the allure of the Illusionist Coven. We like to magic with a hint... [disappears in a cloud of smoke, reappears a few feet to the right] ...of showmanship.

[He bows as the other two appear next to him.]

Luz: Wow! Acceptance? Comradery? A sense of belonging? Covens sound incredible! Eda, why haven't you ever joined one?

Eda: Watch closely, Luz.

[Another Illusion track witch is now standing with one of the other ones.]

Eda: When you join a coven, all your other magic is sealed away.

[A seal in the shape of a mirror appears on the witch's wrist, light blue lines running from it up his arms and face. He pales slightly as the lines fade.]

Eda: From now on, that kid will only be able to make illusions. Since I never joined a coven, I can do every kind of magic. [creates a fireball in one hand and a ball of water in the other, then makes both disappear] That's why I'm the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles.

[She walks away. Willow, Luz, and Gus hurry after her, amazed. King starts to follow, but is stopped with a hand on his shoulder.]

King: Weh?

Student #1: The tea leaves foretell that this [pulls out a pen] will lead you to your destiny. [puts the pen in his hands]

King: Destiny? Feh! I'm not paying for--

Student #1: [retreating into the shadows] It's free-e-e.

King: Are you bestowing gifts upon me? Yes! I accept your offering! The King of Demons is back!

[Cut to the doorway flanked with guards.]

Luz: That panel looks popular.

Gus: [gasps] It's the Emperor's Coven! Do you think they'll sign my forehead?

Willow: Only one way to find out!

[Willow and Gus run inside. Luz starts to follow them, but stops when she realizes Eda hasn't moved.]

Luz: Aren't you coming, Eda?

Eda: No way. Of all the covens, they're the worst. I'll wait out here.

Luz: I get it, Eda. Covens: bad. Individualism: good. But I'm still figuring this world out, so I'm going to go in there and make up my own mind, okay? [She walks in.]

Man #1: [to a guard] I just saw her.

Eda: Huh?

Man #1: [holding Eda's wanted poster] She's over there. I think that's her! [points at her]

Eda: Uh-oh. [runs in] Luz, wait up!

[Cut to a large stadium with a chattering audience. Eda sits down next to Luz.]

Eda: All right, let's see this mess.

[The lights dim. Principal Bump rises from the floor with spirals of green magic, a spotlight illuminating him. The audience applaudes and cheers as he summons a mic.]

Principal Bump: Hello, Bonesborough! Students ask me all the time, "Principal Bump, what's the height of magical achievement?"

Mattholomule: Is it this? [increases the size of his head greatly, crushes the student next to him]

Principal Bump: Wow. I failed you as a principal. [grabs the mic with some feedback] It's being selected to join the best of the best. And there are none better than the jewel of the coven system [three witches appear] and the enforcers of His will, the Emperor's Coven.

Luz: Whoa. [looks to the side and waves]

Willow and Gus: Luz! [pointing to Gus's forehead, which has been signed]

Principal Bump: Feast your eyes on this elite force, each member handpicked to help usher in a new age of controlled magic.

[Each Coven guard traces a white spell circle above their head. One produces a jet of flame, another water, and the third lightning. The three elements come together in a firework that turns to confetti, which Luz grabs.]

Eda: [to the demon next to her] When does that "elite force" get here? [laughs]

[The demon moves away. The Coven guards are now holding the same elements in balls between their hands.]

Principal Bump: Members of the Emperor's Coven have access to all-- yes, all forms of magic. Ooh. Aah.

Audience: Ooh. Aah.

Principal Bump: But... only the best can ascend these ranks. Some day that could be one of you!

[He points directly at Amity, who brightens and squeals.]

Eda: [laughs]

Luz: Hmm?

[The three guards grab their capes and disappear in flashes of white light.]

Principal Bump: And now, I'm pleased to introduce the esteemed leader of this coven and this year's mystery guest. You know her, you love her! Lilith!

[Audience gasps.]

Eda: [stops laughing] Huh?

[A bright flash of light near the ceiling turns into a blue raven sitting on a branch. It flies off the branch to the stage, landing to reveal Lilith. It disappears with a screech as she lifts her arms and sends her mask flying. The audience applauds and cheers, while Eda is looking at her speechless. Luz notices.]

Luz: You know her?

Eda: You could say that.

Luz: [gasps] Mysterious past!

Lilith: Thank you, all. [magically sends her cape and mask back into Principal Bump] It wasn't easy for me to rise to the top. I also started from humble beginnings.

Mattholomule: Like me?

Lilith: Now I have the highest honor of enforcing the Emperor's will. So be more! The Emperor's Coven awaits you!

[She spins, creating the raven illusion again. It spreads its wings before bursting into balls of light. Lilith poses with her arms out, smirking, while Eda glares at her.]

[Cut to outside of the auditorium as Eda and Luz leave.]

Luz: Eda! Where are you going?

Eda: I'm gonna head home and wash the con funk off my skin.

Luz: But we haven't even taken the quiz to determine our coven type!

[She pulls out a thick magazine out of her pocket, flipped to a quiz named "What Coven Are You In?", and holds it above her head. Eda doesn't even look as she casts a lazer beam through it and walks away. Luz pulls the magazine down to read it, walking without looking.]

Luz: Ooh, a punky potionist.

[She runs into Amity, and they both grunt.]

Amity: Watch where you-- Oh, it's you. Willow's... abomination thing.

Luz: Uh... Hey, Amity. So, funny story. Not an abomination. Sorry for the confusion last week. I-I'm Luz. The human. Hi!

[She offers her hand, but Amity smacks it away.]

Amity: Ugh. Put that away. You're the one that got me in trouble with Principal Bump and I never get in trouble. [walks away]

Luz: [follows her] Well, to be fair, you were okay with him trying to dissect me, so--

Amity: [stops and turns around] You can't be here! This covention is for witches only.

Luz: Well, I'm learning how to be a witch. I'm receiving magic lessons from a powerful witch and a ferocious demon.

Amity: [looks over Luz's shoulder] Is that your ferocious demon there?

[Luz turns around to see King, decked out in merch, walking towards them. Two bakers are walking behind him.]

King: Cupcakes in my tummy-tum makes the King say yummy-yum!

Baker: So you'll join the Bakers Coven?

King: [eats a cupcake in one bite] Hmm... Nope! [steals a cupcake off the other baker's tray and runs] Oh, hey, Luz! Look at all those offerings-- [trips on his scarf] Wah!

[Luz goes to help him up. They both reach out for his dropped cupcake, failing to reach it before Amity steps on it. King gasps.]

Amity: Oops. That was an accident.

Luz: Why are you being so mean, Amity?

Amity: Because you and your pet are giving witches in training a bad name.

King: [while scratching his face with his hind leg] I'm not a pet!

Luz: [hugs him] He's a very good boy and the King of Demons! I'll tell you what, Amity. [stands] It's one thing to say I can't be a witch--

Amity: 'Cause you can't.

Luz: ...but it's another thing to bully my friends. Just like The Good Witch Azura said when facing down her rival Hecate at the Bog of Immediate Regret... I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!

[Everyone gasps. Amity takes several steps forward into Luz's face.]

Amity: I accept. Let's set the terms for this duel, shall we?

Luz: One, if I win, you apologize to King for squashing his cupcake.

King: [picking up the ruined cupcake] Good night, sweet child.

Luz: And two, you admit that humans can be witches too.

Amity: Fine by me. But when I win, not only do you have to tell the whole covention you're not a witch, you have to stop training forever.

King: Do it, Luz! For my honor!

Luz: Fine. Let's shake on it.

[Luz holds out her hand. Amity draws a spell circle around it before shaking.]

Amity: The everlasting oath is sealed.

[Amity pulls her hand back and the spell circle fades.]

Luz: That's probably fine.

Amity: Meet back inside the theater in one hour. [walks away] Let's see what kind of witch you are.

Luz: King, I-I can win this, right?

King: [eating his cupcake] Mmm? Oh, yeah. No.

Luz: [whimpers]

[Cut to Eda trying to sneak out of the covention.]

Lilith: Sister?

[Eda stops and turns, seeing Lilith surrounded by several Hexside students.]

Lilith: It's been so long since I've seen you last! [signs something and hands it to Mattholomule] What are you wearing? You look like some sort of trash collector. Oh, right. You are.

Eda: Oh, Lily. I just had to see the leader of the Emperor's Coven in action. [leans down to talk to the students] You know, when we were kids, Lilith was so excited to see the Emperor's Coven, she peed a little.

[The kids laugh, making Lilith blush.]

Lilith: That-- That's all for today. [ushers them off. To Eda] You shouldn't even be here. You're a wanted criminal! Unless... [gasps] I don't believe it! You are here to join the Emperor's Coven!

Eda: [chortles, laughs] In your dreams. [laughing]

Lilith: You think being covenless makes you so much smarter than everyone else. But while you run from the law like a degenerate, I'm mentoring the next generation of powerful witch students into the world.

Eda: Well, I have a student. And I bet she could wipe the floor with any of your prissy little blue bloods.

Lilith: [stepping closer] Is that a challenge?

Eda: Oh, it's a promise.

Luz: [pops up between them] Eda, I need your help! I accidentally challenged Amity to a witch's duel, and I think she's going to kill me all the way dead! [slumps to the ground]

Lilith: Mmm, it seems your student has met my strongest protégé. [kneels down] And look at those ears! [Luz covers them, blushing] Is she human? [chuckles and stands] Where did you even find one of these? Okay, Edalyn.

[Lilith traces a spell circle. Around the building, Eda's wanted posters burn.]

Lilith: For one day, you won't have to hide from the law, because I want to see how good a teacher you really are. [walks away]

Eda: Come on, kid. Time to prepare for bloodshed.

Luz: But... whose blood?

Eda: Anyone's guess! [chuckles]

[Luz smiles nervously. Cut to a hallway, where Eda puts a sweatband on.]

Eda: All right, Luz. Let's start your training. Now, I'm coming at you with a blast of fire. What do you do?

[Luz pulls her hood up and leans off of the box she was sitting on, landing on the floor in fetal position.]

Eda: Oh, that's right. I haven't taught you many spells, huh?

[Luz shakes her head.]

Eda: Boy, I hope you didn't make an everlasting oath to stop learning magic or anything. You'd be toast.

Luz: [sits up] I-Is there a glowy hand thing that happens, or, uh--

Amity: Abomination. Rise.

[Lilith and Amity are standing nearby. An abomination that comes up to Amity's shoulders rises from her spell circle on the ground with a groan. It twists its head off and throws it, hitting a bakers coven witch in the face. Tiny Nose grabs his hand and chucks him.]

Tiny Nose: [screams]

Eda: Ooh, boy.

Luz: I can't believe I'm gonna have to stop learning magic!

Eda: Listen to me, Luz. We are not gonna let those snobs win that easy! We are not gonna let them win at all. I've got an idea.

[Her sweatband rips as her hair wins its fight against it. Cut back to the theater. Lilith and Amity are standing on the dais, while Eda and Luz are standing opposite them.]

Lilith: Beloved citizens, the Emperor's Coven proudly presents an impromptu demonstration of the sort of witch we seek every year. Introducing Amity Blight.

[Crowd cheers.]

Fan: Woo, Amity!

Lilith: Versus...

[Eda steps out of the way and proudly presents a very nervous Luz.]

Lilith: ...some human girl.

[Applause stops.]

Student #3: A human?

Student #4: Humans can't do magic!

Student #5: She's not Amity.

[Willow and Gus share a nervous look.]

Luz: Eda? [grabs Eda's arms] What am I going to do?

Eda: Calm down. [frees herself and points] You see those mounds? Get Amity to land on one of those and she'll set off my magic traps.

Luz: That's cheating!

Eda: Nobody will know. To all eyes up there it'll look like you're performing magic. Just trust me.

Luz: But I will know in my heart! Even if I win now, I lose.

Eda: That's the spirit!

[A bell rings and screams. Luz, still nervous, and Amity, confident, approach each other as the audience cheers. Amity cracks her knuckles. Luz waves.]

Amity: [tracing out a large spell circle] Abomination. Rise.

[An abomination that towers over the two girls groans as it rises out of the spell circle.]

Luz: [whimpers]

Amity: [gasps] Whoa. Show me what you got, human!

Luz: I'm not good under pressure! [runs]

[The abomination groans. It twists its head off and throws it at Luz.]

Luz: [panting] Whoa!

[Its head just misses. Luz is backed against the wall by the advancing abomination, its head regrown. She sinks to the ground in fear, whimpering, and grows nervous when she realizes she's right in front of one of Eda's mounds. She braces as the abomination steps on it. The abomination looks down as a towering jet of fire erupts from the mound.]

Amity: How did you do that?

Luz: I, uh-- [she does jazz hands] Magic?

[King scats as he enters the theater, piled high with hats, shirts, buttons, and scarfs.]

King: ♪ Things that are free ♪ ♪ People are giving offerings to me! ♪ [reaches Willow and Gus] I love offerings! What did I miss?

Willow: Luz is in a witch's duel!

Gus: Yeah! And she can win it all! Yeah-yeah!

King: Weh?

[The steaming abomination steps onto another mound, this one producing a current of air strong enough to launch it and Amity into the air.]

Amity: [screams]

[The abomination grunts as it lands on its back. Amity lands kneeling.]

Amity: I-I saw you that time! You didn't use your hands! What are you getting at?

Luz: Not dying!

[The abomination sits up with a groan, then stomps toward Luz again.]

Luz: [screams and runs]

[Cut to the stands, where King is carefully making his way down the rows.]

King: This I gotta see!

Student #5: [waving a foam finger] Go Amity!

King: Hey! You root for Luz or nobody!

[He tries to run at the student, but gets caught on his scarf again and falls. Cut back to Luz running from the abomination, which sets off an explosion as it steps on a mound. Cut back to King falling down, his "offerings" falling off as he goes. Cut back to Amity advancing on Luz.]

Amity: How are you doing that?

Luz: [sees the mound] No, Amity, don't step any closer!

Amity: Why, Luz? What happens if I step closer?

[King screams as he falls flat on his back, directly on the mound. Spikes burst from the ground, forcing Luz and Amity back several steps.]

King: Mmm? I'm okay!

Luz: [to Eda] Spikes?

[Eda gives her two thumbs up.]

Amity: I knew it! You were cheating!

Luz: Amity-- No!

[Lilith touches the top of a shorter spike, making it crumble.]

Lilith: Oh, Eda. I do believe this means you lose!

Eda: [groans]

Luz: It wasn't my idea to cheat. And when I found out, I tried to stop it, but--

Amity: Who could believe anything you say?

[Amity starts to walk away. Camera focuses on a power glyph on the back of her neck, which Eda notices.]

Eda: Wait just a sec, Miss Protégé.

[Lilith's eyes widen as Eda goes after her. She lifts Amity's hair.]

Amity: Hey! What are you--

[Eda rips the glyph off. The abomination shrinks until it's about the height of Amity's knee, though it crumbles completely when its head crushes it. Eda holds the glyph up to the audience.]

Eda: A power glyph from the Construction Coven.

[Everyone gasps.]

Student #1: [gasps] I mean... I knew it.

Willow: [hushed, to Gus] She cheated!

Eda: Ah-ha! Yes, yes, yes-yes-yes! You cheated. Perfect, prissy Lilith cheated. Hot dang, I love coventions! La-la-la--

Lilith: I only did that because I knew you would cheat!

Eda: Still cheated! Welcome down to my level!

Amity: [rubbing the back of her neck] But... I didn't know!

[She sees Luz approaching and runs off.]

Luz: Amity, wait!

King: Luz! Help me!

[Luz grunts as she frees King, ripping the shirts in the process.]

King: My offerings!

Luz: [pats King's head] You'll get more offerings, King. [runs after Amity]

King: Hey, wait for me! [follows her]

[Eda is dancing. Kind of.]

Lilith: Knock it off. You're making a scene!

Eda: You cheated. Hey, where's the Rhyming Coven? What rhymes with "cheated"?

Lilith: Stop acting like a child!

Eda: You were defeated, don't get heated, get your stank face treated.

Lilith: Rhyme one more thing. I dare you!

Eda: Oh, it's okay, I'm done. [pause] Because my rhymes are depleted!

Lilith: [screaming] That's it!

[Lilith summons her staff and hits Eda with a blast of energy, throwing her through her spikes and into the wall behind the dais. The audience gasps.]

Willow and Gus: [gasp]

[The cloud of Lilith's blue magic clears out. Eda, splayed against the wall, smirks.]

Eda: There she is!

[She summons her own staff and spins it in a circle only for it to fly out of her hand and clatter on the ground. She picks it back up with a roar and sends a burst of energy at Lilith. Lilith grunts and sends one back.]

Student #5: Witch's duel!

[Lilith's blue magic and Eda's orange magic are evenly matched. They explode in a white light. Cut to the entrance to the theater, which Luz runs out of and looks around. She sees Amity sulking in a dark corner next to the bathrooms.]

Luz: [gasps] Amity... [walks over] I'm sorry.

Amity: Ugh, seriously? Just leave me alone.

Luz: I didn't mean to embarrass you.

Amity: That's all you ever do! First at school, and now this!

Luz: Yeah, but--

Amity: [stands] You made me look like a fool in front of the Emperor's Coven. My future! You think it's so easy to be a witch. I have been working my whole life to get to the top! [advancing on Luz] You lost! You cheated! Say it! Say you're not a witch!

Luz: [looks at the ground] I'm not a witch.

[She kneels down, pulling out a notepad and pencil. Amity looks confused as she kneels down with her. Luz slowly draws out the light glyph, then taps it. She gently cups the ball of light produced, smiling at it. She holds it up to Amity.]

Luz: But I'm training hard to be one.

[Amity stares at the light in awe. Cut back to Eda and Lilith's duel, where Lilith is spinning her staff. When Eda's attack stops, she pushes her hand forward, her spell circle turning into a burst of magic. Eda takes a few steps back, spinning and drawing a spell circle on the ground. She lifts her hand, creating a growing pillar of wood that splits Lilith's attack. The pillar bends, its owl face hooting lowly. Lilith stares at it, then teleports away from its approaching beak.]

[Stray magic enters the audience. They scream and flee.]

[Two new owl faces extend from the large pillar. Eda draws four more spell circles on the opposite side. Lilith easily teleports away from all of their beaks, destroying one on the ground, then three in the air with a grunt. Eda smirks and spins her staff, creating an orange shield as Lilith hits it with magic and her staff. The shield cracks, but Eda's expression doesn't change. Owlbert's eyes glow. He flies into Lilith's face, interrupting her attack. He hoots and pulls her hair.]

Lilith: Ow, ow, ow-ow-ow. Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

[Eda's shield falls.]

Eda: Say good night, sister.

[She spins her staff and smacks the butt of it into the wooden pillar. A large owl's face forms right next to Lilith, and with a hoot, it captures her in its beak. All falls silent.]

[Owlbert lands back on Eda's staff. She smiles at him, then looks concerned when she sees the flaming hole in the new owl tube's side. Lilith appears directly behind her.]

Lilith: Enough of this.

Eda: [gasps]

[Eda is thrown into the wall with a scream, leaving a crater. Lilith smirks and spins her staff.]

Eda: Lily, wait. The curse.

[Lilith stops spinning her staff, the gathering magic at her palisman disappearing.]

Eda: Look at me. Look at my face. The curse is worsening and I can't keep up with it. I don't know how much time I have left.

Lilith: [approaches Eda] I'll admit I was surprised when I first saw you today.

Eda: I just had to see my sister for... possibly the last time.

Lilith: Eda, I--

[She screams as a bag of Hex Mix is thrown in her face. She stares at it as it hits the ground.]

Lilith: [growls]

Eda: [running for the exit] It's been fun, but let's call it a draw!

Lilith: Argh!

[Cut back to Luz and Amity.]

Amity: [turns away] That's nothing. A child could do a light spell.

[Luz's expression falls. She extinguishes the ball of light and turns away, scooping up her notepad.]

Amity: But... I've never seen it cast like that.

Luz: It doesn't come naturally to me like it does for you, so I've had to improvise. [nods to the notepad]

Amity: [sighs]

[She traces out a spell circle and drags Luz's hand into it. Their hands glow briefly, and the circle disappears.]

Amity: The oath is unbound. [lets Luz go and stands]

Luz: Did it work? Can I still learn magic?

Amity: Humans have no magical ability. But I doubt that'll stop you.

[Amity leaves. Luz stands, watching her.]

King: Luz! You left me!

Luz: Yeah, sorry. Your legs are just so tiny. Should we get you more offerings?

King: Nah. That stuff just weighed me down. But I have something for you, Luz. And it's the best thing, because it's free, comes from my heart, and I always have more than I need.

Luz: [gasps] Is it love?

King: Ugh! No! [reaches behind him] Tote bags! [puts it on Luz's arm and hops in it as she stands] And they have so many uses! Away, fair chariot! Away!

[Luz pats his head as Eda arrives.]

Eda: We gotta go.

Luz: How'd you get away from Lilith?

Eda: Let's just say she had a real "snack attack." Hah! [snorts and heads for the door] Wait, I got a better one.

Luz: Eda...

[Eda stops and looks back at her.]

Luz: Do you think I'll ever be a true witch?

Eda: What? I don't know. And who's a true witch? These suckers? According to them, that means being in a coven, but I never joined one and I'm better than all of them combined. You gotta be your own witch.

Luz: [brightens] My own witch.

Eda: Now, let's go before my sister realizes I tied her pointy shoes together.

[Lilith screams.]

Eda: And that's our cue! [leaves]

Luz: Sister? Now that's a mysterious past payoff!

Eda: Oh, you think that's all the mystery I got? Wait until you hear about my parents.

Luz: What? You've got parents? I need to know more!

King: You very much don't!

[Cut to a dressing room. Lilith enters, tripping over her tied laces.]

Lilith: [grunts and stands] You make it so hard to want to help you, Edalyn.

[The compact mirror on the counter opens, showing off the insignia of the Emperor's Coven. Lilith gasps.]

Kikimora: [on the mirror] Lilith, I see you let The Owl Lady get the best of your temper. Just remember what Emperor Belos has promised to you.

Lilith: [nods] I will capture her, ma'am. You have my word.

Kikimora: Very good.

[Kikimora fades from the mirror, allowing Lilith's reflection to appear.]

Lilith: Your days are numbered, Edalyn.
