[Open on Luz holding a ball of light in one hand and carrying the Owl Staff in the other through a cave. She stops when she sees a large shadow on the wall in front of her.]
Garlog: [laughs]
Luz: [gasps]
Garlog: Foolish child. Leave this place before you meet your demise.
Luz: Do not underestimate me, Garlog. For I am the good witch, Luz, hunter of monsters. [Perches the staff on her shoulder like a bazooka] Now eat this sucka-- what?
[Garlog torns out to be a tiny creature casting a shadow standing in front of a lantern. Luz picks him up and he lets out a squeak trying to escape.]
Luz: You're Garlog? [pulls out his wanted poster, depicting him as being much larger and worth 4,000 snails, compares it to the real thing] This is pathetic.
Garlog: Small I may be, but you will soon know fear when I lay waste to all that you-
[He gets cut off by King, who eats him whole.]
Luz: King, drop it now. Drop it now!
King: [mumbles, runs off]
Luz: [chases after him] Drop it! No! I'm not gonna play right now! King!
-THEME SONG-
[The Owl House is shown, wind howling. Cut to Luz's room, where Garlog is stuffed in a bottle while Luz sets her phone against it.]
Luz: [boops Garlog's nose] Boop! [turns on camera to say hello to her mother, just like the end of the season finale] Hola, Mama! You haven't heard from me in a while. It's been a week and a half since the petrification ceremony. A week and a half since I destroyed the portal home. I had to. Emperor Belos was going to kill Eda if I didn't hand it over. But I couldn't let him use it, so I blew it up with some magic fire... She's not gonna understand any of this. That's okay, Luz. Just keep moving forward. This world is filled with inexplicable magical wonders, like this portal key! I don't know if it contains magic, but I'm gonna study all I can, and find a way back to you. A-And look! [Lifts up her leg to show King holding onto it] I have friends to help me.
King: I'm never letting you go! You're never returning to the human realm!
Luz: He doesn't mean that. [covers camera]
King: Yes I do!
[Cut to Eda in the kitchen, where she is trying to cast magic.]
Luz: [narrating] This is Eda the Owl Lady, the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles. Or at least she was until her curse overpowered her and weakened her magic. She's doing her best now.
[Scene switches to Lilith, who is wearing a new outfit and putting her old one away.]
Luz: [narrating] Eda was cursed by her own sister, Lilith. And she spent her entire life looking for a way to undo it. It's still hard for everyone to trust each other, but maybe with time we can all become friends.
[Lilith stares out of the open window pensively, a small smile appearing on her face as Luz narrates. She jumps when Hooty appears in the window.]
Hooty: Hello!
Lilith: [screams, slams the window in Hooty's face]
[Cut to outside the Owl House. Eda is seen constructing something.]
Luz: [narrating] Even though Eda gets frustrated, she's found new ways to make up for her lost powers.
Eda: Check it, Luz! A new hunting weapon. I will call her the Stab-Catcher.
Luz: [narrating] Without the portal, Eda has no human garbage to sell. So, we've resorted to working odd jobs to keep food on the table.
Eda: Hey, King, did you know that apple is a hat? [aims Stab-Catcher]
King: Really? [puts an apple on his head, not knowing he's standing behind a target]
Luz: King! Hey, no! King! [drops camera, rushes to get King out of harm's way] This week we're bounty hunters. Next week we could be anything. So, Mom, please don't be scared. I'm growing more and more every day, and I'm gonna do my best to become a full-fledged witch, and get home to you safe and sound. Te quiero, Mama. Te lo prometo, regresaré a casa pronto.
Eda: Luz! Time to bring these bad boys to market!
Lilith: [grunts] Eda, do you own anything that isn't covered in feathers?
Eda: I had to deal with a curse for 30 years, so I think you can handle a few feathers.
[Switch to Bonesborough, where a statue of Emperor Belos has been placed and Emperor's Coven guards are everywhere.]
Luz: Wow, the Emperor is really taking over.
Eda: I see it too, Luz. And I'm trying to stay civil. [kicks a demon decked out in Emperor's Coven apparel]
[Eda places the bag of captured demons on a scale. She and Luz wait while a shopkeeper behind a booth reading BOUNTY reads the scale.]
Shopkeeper: Tsk. Your payment.
Eda: A single snail? Are you kidding me?
Shopkeeper: [laughs] Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't done yet. [snaps snail in half]
Eda: You can't do this to me. Do you know who I am?
Shopkeeper: Yeah, you're Eda the Owl Lady. What are you gonna do? We all know you're powerless now.
Eda: [growls, tries to cast a spell but the spell circle disintegrates] Ah! What the--
Townspeople: Ah, this is awkward; Uh-oh
Eda: I don't need your pity. [holds up her own wanted poster] I was the most wanted criminal for years. You should fear me.
[A passing garbageman grabs her wanted poster and puts it in the trash cart he is pushing.]
Townspeople: No magic? Not so wanted anymore.
Lilith: [laughs] Don't worry, sister. At least my image still commands respect and fear.
[She poses in front of a Coven recruitment poster in which she is making the same pose. The poster is promptly torched by a garbageman holding a flamethrower.]
King: [laughs] You're a traitor.
Lilith: What's going on? This is anarchy. Who told you to do this?
[Three new Coven recruitment posters of the Golden Guard fly onto the wall. Luz grabs one.]
Luz: The Golden Guard? Did you know him in the Coven, Lilith?
Lilith: Unfortunately, I did. [grabs the poster Luz did] He always got special treatment because he was the genius teen prodigy. But he's really just a brat. If he's in charge... vomit.
[Lilith balls up the poster and throws it to a trashcan. It hovers right before entering, and then flies back and adheres itself to Lilith's face. She tries to rip it off, but gives up and stalks off.]
Luz: [side-hugs Eda] Hey, I know! What we need is a confidence boost. Why don't we take on the biggest bounty we can find? It'll be great! [runs up to a bulliten board labeled "Greg's List" and reads the posters there] Hmm. Lost Cerberus, no. Witch cackling lessons? [chuckles] Uh, but maybe not today. Aha! [takes poster down and shows it off] There's something called a "Selkidomus" ravaging boats up and down the coast. We'll be on a high-seas adventure.
Eda: Hmm...no. We gotta keep a low profile while my powers are weakened. And we need fast cash. [gasps] How about this guy? [gestures to a poster]
Luz: "The Abominable Cutie Pie"?
Eda: No, no, no. I hear it's very dangerous. [gasps] And look, there he is.
[She points to where the little demon is standing between two Hexside students, a lollipop in his hand.]
Abominable Cutie Pie: [giggles; runs off and climbs the statue of Emperor Belos] You'll never catch me!
[Luz climbs the statue.]
Abominable Cutie Pie: [deadpan] You did it. You caught me. [falls into Luz's hands]
Luz: [groans]
[King climbs up to Luz.]
Eda: [sighs] Things aren't looking great, Lily. This bounty hunting stuff isn't putting food on the table.
Lilith: [mumbling]
Eda: Oh, I'm sure Luz could handle bigger bounties, but if we wanna eat we don't have the luxury to mess up even once.
Lilith: [mumbling]
Eda: No apple blood. I spent the money on griffin eggs for Luz. There's not a lot she can digest here, so I make sure to have her favorites around.
[The sisters head off.]
Abominable Cutie Pie: That's rough, buddy. [screams as King shoves him to the ground]
[Luz lands on top of the Abominable Cutie Pie after jumping to the ground.]
Luz: This is awful. Eda wouldn't be in this situation if it weren't for me. Maybe it would be better if I never came here. I can't change the past, but I can still change the future. I'm gonna help Eda and prove that I'm more than just a burden.
[Cut to the Bonesborough Dock, where she slams the Selidomus's wanted poster onto a barrel.]
Luz: The Selkidomus hunt. I want in.
[Ship horn blowing.]
Salty: You think you can handle this, squirt?
Luz: I can handle anything.
[Salty lets Luz in and nods at the Golden Guard, who closes the window of his quarters bearing the Emperor's sigil.]
[Cut back to The Owl House, where Lilith holds her now burned recruitment poster. Eda sneaks up on her, wearing a bandolier of orange potions.]
Eda: Hey, Lily! How do I look? [shows off bandolier]
Lilith: Uh...
Eda: [flops onto the couch] Getting scammed at the market was such a bummer, but it gave me an idea on how to earn a little more cash. You wanna come? I may not be at full power, but I can still make potions! [dangles a potion over Lilith's head]
Lilith: I am quite fine. Thank you. [pushes Eda away]
Eda: Aight. [walks to the door] Have fun wallowing in self-pity and feeling bad for cursing me. Byeeeeeee! [leaves]
Lilith: [rips poster bits out of her hair and sighs] I guess I deserve this. There's gotta be a way to make it up to her. [sees a potions book and grabs it] Edalyn isn't the only Clawthorne with a talent for potions. [chuckles as opens to a page for a scrying potion] Ooh. I bet she would love a peek inside the castle.
[Lilith rips the page out and starts backing away, straight into Hooty.]
Hooty: New roomie check-in!
Lilith: [screams, falls and drops book and page]
Hooty: How's my bestie doing? [notices page on his face] A scrying potion!? [gasps] Lulu, you're trying to spy on your old buddies? I can help! We can find out their crushes. [rubs his face against Lilith's] We can give them cute couple names!
Lilith: [shoves Hooty away] No! [stands] I can do this alone. Don't follow me! [starts to leave, stops in the doorway] And don't call me Lulu! [leaves]
Hooty: [to himself] A good friend would respect her wishes, but a better friend would help no matter what! [goes after Lilith, closing the door as he goes]
[Cut to Salty's ship sailing through the Boiling Sea.]
Luz: When we defeat the Selkidomus and get a boatload of snails, Eda won't have to worry about money for a long time.
King: King want a cracker!
Salty: All hands!
[Luz joins the rest of the crew, lined up in front of Salty.]
Salty: Alright, crew. The Selkidomus has been ravaging the coastline. It was last seen in the Simmering Shoals. You know the drill, "Snag the quarry, [drops large sack of snails onto the deck] get the money galore-y." We all do the work, we all get a cut.
[All cheering.]
Fish Sailor: I have many debts!
Salty: Till then, keep everything shipshape. This ain't no pleasure cruise. [throws a broom to Luz] Don't be a burden, sea squirt.
Luz: Oh, you don't have to worry about me.
[Cut to barnacles on the front of the ship, then reveal Salty offer Luz a scraper. She gives King, on her shoulder, a look and uses a plant glyph to lower herself down. The barnacles grunt at her.]
Luz: Hiss.
[The barnacle all quiet down. Luz uses King's horn to scrape them off the ship. Cut to the bellows of the ship, which Salty is shoveling coal in to. He offers the shovel to Luz, but she shakes her head and pushes it away. She activates three fire glyphs directly into the bellows and closes the door. The ship's horn blows as the ship speeds ahead. Salty nods. Cut to the main deck, where the crew is clapping in time with Luz dancing. She turns around to reveal a large bug on her back. She launches it over King -- holding a cracker -- and various birds into the sea.]
Luz: [shivers, grunts]
Salty: Well, ye had me confront my own biases and I got nothing but respect for ya now, squirt. I mean, sailor.
Luz: Thanks, Salty. You make me feel like a real part of the crew.
Salty: Well, that's because you arghhhh.
[All cheering.]
King: Boo!
[He waves his cracker in displeasure. One of the birds tries to grab it from him.]
King: Hey, that's mine, you feather duster!
[King and the bird both tug at the cracker. The ship hits a large wave, which sends King tumbling into the capitan's quarters. The doors close behind him.]
King: Oof. Hey, King want a cracker! [tries to open the doors, gasps, sees box of crackers on the desk] Ooh!
[King scrambles up the desk and grabs some crackers from the box. He notices a letter below the box.]
King: Huh? [picks up letter] Is that the Emperor's sigil?
[King turns up the brightness on the lamp next to him. The brighter light reveals that the room is covered in the Emperor's sigil.]
King: This ship belongs to the Emperor? Oh, boy. I gotta tell Luz.
Golden Guard: Unfortunately, you won't have the chance.
King: [screams]
[Cut to the middle of the woods, where Lilith is consulting the scrying potion recipe.]
Lilith: Okay, next is firebee honey.
[Two firebees fly past her, into a whole colony. Lilith tries to follow, but the moment her foot enters their territory, they swarm together and fly at her.
Lilith: [screams]
[She draws a very shaky spell circle, which produces a sweating ice cube that would easily fit into a glass and offers no defense against a swarm of angry bees. She runs behind a tree, in which several firebees plunge their stingers.]
Lilith: [slides to the ground] How can I get firebee honey without ice magic, or porcuspine quills without a sleeping spell? Who am I without magic, without a Coven? [buries her head in her knees]
Hooty: Without friends?
[Lilith looks up, and Hooty is poking out of the ground next to her. She points at him accusingly.]
Lilith: I said--
Hooty: [stretches into her space] You don't know how to get those firebees, but I can help.
Lilith: No! [pushes him away] I don't want your help. I told you not to follow me!
Hooty: If I were you, I would--
Lilith: You would what? [stands and paces] Because it doesn't matter. You aren't me. You're just some kind of weird bird-worm!
[Hooty looks genuinely hurt by this.]
Lilith: You have no idea what I'm going through. I have to do this alone, because if I can't... what kind of witch am I?
Hooty: Sorry, Lulu. I mean, sorry, Lilith. [retreats into the ground]
Lilith: Now, let's try this one more time. [grabs a branch and looks at the colony]
[Cut to Salty's ship, which enters darker waters.]
Salty: We're here. The Simmering Shoals. Eyes peeled, mates.
[A burning ship sails past. Sailors take off their hats and pay respects.]
Salty: She's close.
[The Selkidomus tail thwacks against the side of the ship.]
Luz: She's here!
[Luz corners the Selkidomus with ice pillars, then wraps it in vines. She starts pulling it onto the ship.]
Salty: Help her, boys! Put your backs into it.
[Luz ties the vine onto the ship.]
Luz: I did it!
[Explosion on deck. Luz falls. The Selkidomus breaks free and swims away. Luz sees a silhouette of someone carrying a bag of money.]
Salty: Is that a-- a ghost pirate?
Luz: The money! We're being robbed.
[The thief jumps off the ship onto a speedboat and heads to a nearby island. Luz summons a boat-shaped block of ice, jumps on, then propels herself with a fire spell after them.]
Salty: [laughing] Show that specter what for, Luz.
[Luz closes in on the shore. The ice has melted to barely support her feet. She loses her balance and is sent flying, colliding into the thief who drops the money at the shore. It opens and it gets washed away. Closeup of Luz and the thief's face.]
Luz and thief: The money!
[The thief's eyes are gold and grey. Luz walks over and knocks off her hat, revealing it's Eda.]
Luz: Eda!
Eda: [sheepishly chuckling] Hey.
Luz: Why are you robbing our ship? And what happened to your legs?
Eda: It's called "disguising your tracks". Now, why were you on that ship to begin with? You coulda gotten killed!
Golden Guard: That can still be arranged.
[Ad break]
Golden Guard: Hello, criminals. What's about to happen should be relatively painless, if you just do what I say.
Luz: And why would we do that?
Golden Guard: Because none of you can use real magic.
Eda: You don't know that!
Golden Guard: Maybe not, but I do know you're standing on a plant that eats flesh.
Golden Guard: Okay--the human will remain a sailor to repay all the money she lost, while the Owl Lady will be arrested, again, for attacking one of the Emperor's ships.
Luz: "Emperor's ship"?
Eda: They're the only ones worth robbing. Why are you guys hunting the Selkidomus? It's a peaceful creature, and you're provoking it!
Golden Guard: The Emperor ordered me to slay one. I'm just following orders.
Eda: Well, I'm just gonna smack you around a bit! [rips off her arm to use as a weapon, swings but misses and is blasted away]
Luz: Leave Eda alone!
Golden Guard: How about... I leave you dangling above the Boiling Sea!?
Golden Guard: Around these parts, just the steam is enough to cause third-degree burns.
Golden Guard: But I don't have to be that mean. No one will have to be a sailor or get arrested, if one of you follows those Selkidomus tracks and slays the beast. Here! I'll help!
[He materializes a sword. Luz whines.]
Golden Guard: Ugh, you're making this difficult... Go, or I drown the bird.
[The Golden Guard lifts up the birdcage and pulls the shade aside, revealing King.]
King: Weh?
[The Golden Guard drops the shade.]
King: Ah, it's dark now. [snoring]
Luz: Fine. I'll do it.
Eda: Luz, wait! Luz!
[Cut to Lilith, encircled by a ring of firebees.]
Lilith: I am not one to be trifled with, bees. I am a witch... unhinged!
[She swings at the bees with a stick, making battlecries. Lilith pulls it out and realizes it's burnt.]
Lilith: What? No, no, no, no, no!
[She falls to the ground, ring of bees closing in.]
Lilith: I can't do this alone. I need help!
[Hooty emerges out of the ground.]
Hooty: I'm here for you, Lulu. No witch is an island. Now face my wrath!
Lilith: [clapping] Ooh.
[Cut to Luz and Eda.]
Eda: Luz, don't hurt the Selkidomus. We can find another way out of this.
Luz: You heard what he said, Eda. If you and King want to be free... then I have to do this alone.
Eda: What's this "alone" business? Don't you remember? Us weirdos have to--
Luz: What? Stick together? Because you stuck with me, you lost your magic. You almost got turned to stone, and now you can't even afford your apple blood because you're worried about what I need to eat. It's my fault all this happened. That's why I've got to do this alone. I'll make it all up to you, Eda the Owl Lady. I promise.
[Luz falls backwards, down into the Selkidomus' den.]
Eda: Luz!
[Luz falls straight onto the Selkidomus' head. She stirs and roars.]
Luz: Whoa!
[She dodges a Selkidomus attack, and holds up a glyph.]
Luz: All right, let's do this.
[Luz summons an ice pillar, but Eda swings on a vine and grabs Luz mid-air, tackling her into cover.]
Eda: You think throwing your life away is gonna help me? Well, it won't. You helped me find King's crown when you barely knew me. You saved me from turning to stone and you even got me talking to my sister again. So, unfortunately for you, my life is pretty great, because I'm friends with Luz, the human.
[Luz starts tearing up, but stops when Eda grabs her cheeks.]
Eda: Now, your guilt-ridden brain is clouding your judgement. There's gotta be a way out of this, where no one has to get hurt.
[Behind them, a baby Selkidomus sounds.]
Luz: [gasping] Eda, do you want to learn your first glyph?
[Above them, the Golden Guard is playing with King's birdcage. He lifts the shade. King wakes up and spins around.]
King: Weh?
[He drops the shade. King sighs in relief. The Golden Guard lifts the shade. King wakes up and spins around.]
King: Weh?
[He drops the shade. King sighs in relief. The Golden Guard lifts the shade. King wakes up and spins around.]
King: Weh?
[He drops the shade. King sighs in relief.]
Golden Guard: [laughing] You're actually weirdly endearing.
King: No, I'm not. [snoring]
[The Golden Guard looks up and sees shadows on the wall of Eda and Luz fighting the Selkidomus. Luz slays her, and begins dragging her head into the Golden Guard's view.]
Golden Guard: Oh, that thing smells awful. Why are you touching it with your hands? Gross.
Luz: You're gross. Now give me King.
Golden Guard: Actually, he smells pretty bad too. Take him.
[He tosses her King's birdcage.]
Golden Guard: Thank you for your service. You can find your own way home. And try to stay out of trouble. [looking sinister] The Emperor is not a merciful man. [waves] Byeeeee!
[The Golden Guard gets on his staff and vanishes. Luz blows a raspberry after he leaves. Beside the Selkidomus corpse, actually made entirely out of plant magic, Eda is drawing light glyphs and casting them, like when Luz first learned it. Luz walks up to her.]
Eda: My first glyph. Did I do good?
Luz: Yeah. You did great.
[Enter the Selkidomus and her baby. The baby comes up to Luz and hugs her.]
Luz: Baby! Awww.
King: Wait, what is that?
Eda: Don't worry, King. Once the mother saw we weren't a threat to her baby, she calmed down. [to the Selkidomus] This area is dangerous. You need to move further out into the sea.
[The Selkidomus nods, then regurgitates a pile of golden selkigris.]
Eda: Hot dang! It gave you the treasure of the sea.
Luz: Gold? Tuna?
Eda: It's selkigris. Ah, people pay big money for it at the Night Market. Ah, feel that money, Luz. [lathers a handful of the stuff on Luz's face]
Luz: No, Eda! Stop!
Eda: Luxuriate in it. What, you don't like to luxuriate? There's a whole pile of luxury right in here.
Luz: No, no, no, no, no.
[Eda throws Luz into the Selkigris.]
Eda: Move over!
[Eda jumps in, flattening the pile.]
Luz: Eda!
[They all laugh. Cut to Lilith at the Owl House, putting ointment on Hooty's stings.]
Lilith: I'm sorry for sending you away before. It's hard for me to ask for help.
Hooty: It's okay. I'm sorry for being all nosy-nosy. But hey, Lulu, every friendship comes with its ups and downs. Right, best friend?
Lilith: I'm not commenting on that, Hootsifer.
Hooty: A nickname? [laughing] Hoot.
[The cauldron with Lilith's scrying spell finishes brewing. It glows and bubbles.]
Lilith: [gasps] The scrying potion, it's ready.
[A tired Eda, Luz, and King walk through the door.]
Eda: We're home. [trips over Hooty]
Lilith: Eda, come here. I have a gift for you. To prove that I'm trustworthy, I'm giving you a peek inside the Emperor's castle.
[Cauldron shows a corridor at the Emperor's Castle that splits into two paths. Four distracted guards at each side are doing nothing. A guard on the left turns to the guard on the right.]
Guard 1: 'Sup?
Guard 2: 'Sup?
Luz: What are we supposed to do with this?
Lilith: Whatever you want. Don't you see? These troops don't know what to do with themselves. So, go crazy. Pull whatever pranks your heart desires. They're clueless without me.
Eda: Oh, Lily, you couldn't have been more right. And that Golden Guard... what a chump. Oh, I'm in a good mood. Who wants to get takeout and draw faces on Hooty?
Hooty: [shakes head] No...
King and Luz: Yay! Me, me, me! I do! Yeah! I'm in!
Lilith: I'll protect you, Hootsifer.
[Zoom into the cauldron. The Owl House is still having their conversation about take-out offscreen.]
Eda: Alright, what do we wanna eat?
Luz: Anything but seafood.
King: Crackers.
Eda: We're not ordering crackers.
Hooty: Bees!
Lilith: I'm fine with whatever. Things are starting to feel right again.
[The potion zooms in through a wall, to where Belos is pieicing together the portal door. He puts his mask on as he turns around.]
Belos: Knock, knock, human.
