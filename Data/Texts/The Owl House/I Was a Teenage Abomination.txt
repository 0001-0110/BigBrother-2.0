[Open the sun, panning down to show Luz, Eda, and King standing on a beach.]

Eda: Well, Luz! [elbows her] Did you ever in your life think you'd see something as breathtaking as this?

[She gestures to the corpse of a trash slug that towers over them. It's surrounded by trash and muck. Flies audibly buzz around the corpse.]

Luz: [shaking her head] I don't like this. [She plugs her nose.]

Eda: [walks to the trash slug] Yes, it doesn't get much more inspiring than the trash slug. It makes a home, a life from what others have thrown by the wayside. [pulls a rubber chicken from the trash slug's mouth] Until, blam, it gets blasted by a wave one day and croaks from all the salt. And then we get to sell the stuff it ate. [She pulls out a pickaxe.]

Luz: Please don't make me.

King: [walking away] Aw, come on, Luz. [unfurls a towel] It's not every day you get to go to the dump and pick apart a garbage carcass.

Eda: Ah, nuts to you both.

[Eda swings the pick at the trash slug.]

Luz: So, Eda...

[Glass shatters.]

Luz: What if we tried some new lessons for my apprenticeship? Like...

[Something crashes.]

Luz: Read ancient scrolls or mix together potions, or‐

Eda: [while tossing things from the trash slug's mouth] Ugh. That sounds like a bunch of magic school stuff.

Luz: Wait. Is there a magic school here? Like, winding towers, cute uniforms, dark plots that threaten your life kind of magic school?

Eda: Mm‐hmm. What's worse, they force you to learn magic the "proper" way. But magic isn't proper. It's wild and unpredictable. And that's why it's so beautiful. I didn't finish school, and look at me! Who wouldn't envy where I am right now?

[Flies are flying around the pile of trash Eda is currently standing in. Luz's expression falls.]

Eda: Uh... Hey, here's a lesson. [drops her pick] A great witch is resourceful, [sticks Luz's hand in a puddle of trash slug bile] like this.

[Eda drags Luz's hand back and forth before letting go. Luz continues digging until she pulls something out.]

Luz: Oh, hey. Greasy slime ball.

Eda: [closes Luz's hands around the slime ball] Use your slime ball wisely, young witch. [stands and heads back for the trash slug] Back at it! We'll hit the stink nodes first.

Luz: Actually, if it's okay, [starts backing away] I think I'll head home and look at pictures of animals that are still... alive. Love you, King. [pets his belly]

King: [giggles]

Luz: You little beach peach. [continues walking into the woods]

King: [sighs]

Eda: [shrugs] More for me, then.

[She climbs into the trash slug, sending several things clattering.]

Eda: There we go. Okay.

[She tosses out a cheese grater, an electric fan, and a tuba, the last of which lands on King's head.]

King: Ow! [struggles to free himself]

Eda: This is awesome!

-THEME SONG-

[A monster that looks very distantly related to a butterfly flies across the woods, panting. Luz walks down the path, glaring at the slime ball.]

Luz: Ugh! If magic's all about digging for slime balls, maybe I don't have the stomach for it. [pockets the slime ball]

Girl's voice: You can do it! You can!

Luz: [looks around] Mysterious voice of encouragement? [looks through bushes and gasps] No! Little witch girl.

Girl: [stands to pace around] You can do it. Even if you get a bad grade, it's not a reflection of you as a witch. And my parents are right. [stops pacing] There are better opportunities on this track. Now, get to school! [steps forward and points confidently, but gets sad when she realizes she stepped on a flower] Oh, no! Oh, little friend! I'm sorry!

[She kneels down and repeatedly traces a spell circle. The flower perks back up and fully blooms.]

Luz: [gasps]

[The girl's ear wiggles as something rumbles off screen. She turns as a wagon, being moved by magic, rolls to a stop in front of her, carrying a pot and a girl reading a book.]

Mean Girl: [looks away from her book] Willow! Wow. [hops off the pot] You're so unnoticeable I almost rolled into ya. [chuckles]

[The flower that Willow just healed wilts.]

Willow: Hi, Amity. [stands up]

Amity: Uh, shouldn't you get to class early to prep your...

[Rattling cuts her off. They turn to Willow's pot as it spills, pouring out a purple substance and an eyeball that blinks and groans.]

Amity: Oh, Willow. You don't have anything to show, do you?

Luz: Witch drama!

[Willow pulls up her hood as she blushes.]

Amity: [sighs] This is why people call you "Half‐a‐Witch Willow."

[Rattling.]

Amity: Oh, looks like someone wants to say something to you. [takes the cover off her pot] Abomination, [snaps] rise.

[Her abomination rises, becoming more solid until it's humanoid in shape. It bends out of the pot to poke Willow's forehead, leaving behind mud in a star-shape.]

Abomination: You're a... star.

Amity: Aw. It's like mine. [readjusts a star shaped badge that reads "Top Student"] But much smaller and meaningless. As top student, it's my duty to tell you to keep at it. [puts an arm around Willow] Even you could get a passing grade someday. Abomination, cower.

[It groans as it melts back into the pot. Amity replaces the pot lid and takes hold of the cart.]

Amity: See you in class, superstar.

[Amity walks away. Willow removes her hood. As Amity leaves, Luz sticks her tongue out at her.]

Willow: "Oh, see you in class, superstar!" [wipes the star from her forehead] I hate when she does that.

[Luz flinches as she watches. Wind blows leaves around Willow as she rants.]

Willow: I hate making abominations. I hate getting bad grades. Ugh! I can't stand this anymore. [shouts, her eyes glowing green]

Luz: [gasps]

[The flower from earlier gets lost among giant thorny roots that burst out around it. They surround Willow, glowing and writhing angrily. One snakes out and grabs Luz by the ankle.]

Luz: [screams]

[The root drops Luz on the ground a bit behind Willow, who turns and glares at her, her eyes still glowing. Cut back to the beach, where Eda is tying a sack to her staff as King watches.]

Eda: Not a bad haul. That oviduct was loaded.

King: Ah. Lose apprentice, gain garbage eggs. Fair trade.

Eda: [scoffs] I didn't lose anything.

King: If you don't teach Luz right, you will. And that's when I come in, make her my apprentice.

Eda: Ha! And what would you teach? How to get stuck in the arm of a sweater?

King: Hey, that only happened once! I'd teach her about demons. How to identify them, talk to 'em, raise an army with them and tear apart the world!

Eda: After they tear you out of the sweater arm, right?

King: You think you're so smart! Well, [hops off the trash he's sitting on toward Eda] why don't we make a little bet where I can prove that I'd make a better teacher.

Eda: Okay. [reaches into her hair] I'm obligated to remind you that I only use our bets to utterly humiliate you. [pulls out a book called "Eda + King One Sided Wagers"] And... [opens it] that you've never won.

King: I like those odds.

Eda: So how's this? [grabs an egg] Teach this trash slug to be your loyal soldier in one day. Prove that you can be a better teacher than me, and Luz is all yours. But if you don't, I change your name from King to... Mr. Wiggles.

King: Well, when you lose, you'll have to... wear a shame hat and sleep in a shack and never come into the Owl House again! Ha!

Eda: Deal.

King: [squeaks as he stamps his paw to a page]

[Eda tosses the egg at King's head, breaking it and leaving a baby trash slug between his horns. It slips down his skull, but King catches it. It coos at him.]

Eda: [walking away] Ha ha!

[Cut back to the forest, where Luz is watching in awe as the roots are still writing around Willow. She finally seems to snap out of it, leaning forward worriedly and letting the roots fall.]

Willow: Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I'm so sorry! [makes the roots still wrapped around Luz's legs retreat]

Luz: [rubs her leg] It's okay. The thorns only went through a few layers of skin.

[Willow gets very close to Luz, forcing her to lean back a bit.]

Willow: So... circly.

Luz: [squeals and covers her ears]

Willow: [gasps] You're human! This is astounding! [gasps and grabs Luz's face, then helps her stand and walks around her] A human on the Boiling Isles! How'd you get here? What are you doing here?

[Bells pealing.]

Willow: [flinches and puts Luz's arm down] Uh, I'm sorry. I can't stay. I have to go disappoint my teacher. It was nice to meet you, human. [walks away, half-waving]

Luz: [half-waves back, then rushes after her] Wait! I'm Luz. And you're Willow, right? What you did with that flower and those plants, it was... wow.

Willow: Thanks, but... I'm not even supposed to be doing plant magic. My parents put me in the abomination track at school.

Luz: [squeals, grabbing Willow] Like, magic school?

[Willow nods.]

Luz: That's so cool! [lets Willow go] I'm so jealous. I have a teacher, but her lessons are a bit... untraditional. I bet she wouldn't even let me enroll. But I wish I could spend one day there.

Willow: I wish I could get a passing grade for once. Then people would stop calling me "Half‐a‐Witch Willow."

[She kicks her spilled abomination, which groans.]

Luz: Hey, wait. I know how we can both get what we want. [picks up abomination goo in both hands and splashes it on her hoodie] Make me your abomination. I'll get you a good grade, and you can get me into magic school. It's fiendishly clever.

Willow: What?

Luz: I saw that girl's thing. It's just chunks of stuff that talks weird. I'm chunks of stuff, and I talk weird!

Willow: That's true. [giggles] Okay. It's a deal. Luz.

[They shake hands.]

Luz: This is a great plan.

[They try to pull their hands apart, but the abomination goo on Luz's leaves them stuck together.]

Willow: Oops. Abomination goo.

[Luz uses her foot to free them, but the force sends her splashing in the goo on the ground.]

Luz: Great plan.

[Willow perks up. Cut to the exterior of a school.]

Willow: Welcome to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics. Remember to stay hidden, okay?

[Luz, of inside Willow's abomination pot, squeals and giggles. Cut to the interior of Hexside. Willow stops at a locker, tickling it to make it open its mouth and give her her books. A shorter witch reading a magazine bumps into her.]

Willow: Hmm?

Boy: Willow, you would not believe humans.

Willow: Humans? Psh. I haven't seen any. What?

Boy: [showing her the magazine] Did you know that humans nail barbed wire to their kids' teeth? But why? Maybe to make them magnetic.

Luz: Actually, it's for storing treats.

[He looks confused.]

Willow: Okay, Augustus. I'm gonna tell you something. But you have to be cool.

Gus: I can be spool. [stammers] I mean, cool.

Willow: Okay. Abomination, rise.

Luz: [stands out of the pot] Ta‐da! I'm an abomination.

Willow: Luz, that's not how abominations act.

Gus: [drops his magazine] No. No, it, [plays with his ears while staring at Luz's] it couldn't be.

Willow: He's the president of the Human Appreciation Society. Most witches wouldn't be able to recognize a human right away. But Augustus is an expert.

Gus: Where are your gills?

Luz: I knew an Augustus back in the human world. We called him Gus.

Gus: Gus? Nickname? Human nickname? Gus? Call me it. Wow. Gus. This is the best day of my life.

[A bell screams.]

Gus: I've gotta get to spelling class. [grabs his magazine and a wand before running off] See you guys at lunch!

Willow: [waves at Gus] All right. Into the darkness you go.

Luz: [hisses as she sinks down]

[Cut to the outside of the Owl House, where King is giving the baby trash slug a dog treat.]

King: Aw. Who's a good Prince, Jr.? Who's a good guy?

Eda: [in a lounge chair drinking out of a coffee mug] Hey, Mr. Wiggles. You're not gonna teach it anything doing that.

King: It's called positive reinforcement, Eda. And it works wonders.

[Prince Jr. eats the treat King was dangling in front of it and doubles in size.]

King: Ha ha! See? Now watch this. Prince, Jr.! Attack Eda! Knock over her drink! Mess up her hair!

Eda: [deadpan] Oh, no. Please stop.

King: Well, I haven't seen your student in forever. For all we know, she's not even loyal to you anymore.

Eda: Ha-ha-ha, you wish. But yeah. Where is she?

[Cut to Abomination 101.]

Male student: Hope I pass.

Female student: I'm confident about this.

[Female student with ram horns stands at the front of the room with an abomination with eight feet sticking out of it in various places.]

Abomination Teacher: Hmm. Too many toenails in unexpected places. Fail. Pathetic!

[The abomination and the student deflate. She wheels her abomination off the platform at the front of the room.]

Abomination Teacher: The biggest abominations are all of you! If the next abomination is a failure, everyone gets extra homework for a month!

[All grumbling.]

Male student: Extra homework? Not again!

Abomination Teacher: [clears throat] And the next one to come up is...

Amity: Excuse me, sir, but I am ready to present my abomination. Rise!

[It rises from the pot, groaning, and poses.]

Abomination Teacher: [chuckles] I've always saved the best for last, Amity. You'll have to wait your turn. How about... Willow.

Male student: Not Half‐a‐Witch.

Female student: Great. Homework for a month.

Luz: [peeks out of the pot] Don't listen to them, Willow. We can do this.

[Willow gives her a small smile and nods. She wheels her pot to the front of the room and sets it down nervously.]

Willow: Uh... Abomination, rise.

Luz: [punches the lid off and jumps out] Ta‐da!

[All gasp.]

Willow: Abomination, bow.

Luz: [grunts] Blah!

Abomination Teacher: Very impressive. But does it speak?

Luz: Uh, I may be your abomination, but you're my a‐mom‐ination.

Students: Aw!

Abomination Teacher: [laughs] "A‐mom‐ination!" Splendid wordplay. A plus!

[Students cheer.]

[The bell screams, coughs. Students leave the room.]

Abomination Teacher: Wonderful work today, Willow. Looks like we have a new top student.

[Amity, who was leaving the room, gasps and drops her books as she stops. The Abomination Teacher takes her top student badge.]

Amity: [growls and reaches for her badge] But...

[The Abomination Teacher pins the badge to Willow's cowl.]

Willow: Uh‐‐ Thank you, sir.

[He nods and his abomination carries him away. Willow turns to leave, but Amity is standing in front of her.]

Amity: Hey.

Willow: [gasps]

Amity: Last time I saw you, your abomination was mush. What did you do?

Willow: I, uh, took your pep talk to heart, Amity.

Amity: I bet you did. I've got my eyes on you, Half‐a‐Witch. That badge is mine. [She walks backwards, not breaking eye contact with Willow even as she bumps into another student.]

Student: Hey!

Willow: [after Amity rounds a corner] Uh‐oh. I think Amity is onto us.

[Cut to the front door of the Owl House, which is slammed open by Eda.]

Hooty: OW!

Eda: Have you seen Luz?

Hooty: I heard her tiny mouse feet walking close by. Or that might've been some mice. Anyway, someone started moving in that direction. [slightly gesturing with his head] Hoo, hoo‐hoo, hoo.

Eda: Are you trying to point, or--?

Hooty: Look at the weather vane!

[She does.]

Eda: But the only thing that way is the... [gasps] No. [runs off] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[She reaches Hexside and looks into various windows. The first is a kindergarten classroom.]

Teacher #1: Okay, everyone. Recite your runes.

Kids: Krom, Zix, Elgrim, Zenomide‐‐

Eda: No. Blind obedience.

[The next classroom has several older students writing at desks while a snake-like teacher speaks.]

Teacher #2: Heximal system time! Let's get memorizin'!

Eda: No! Pointless busywork!

[Luz, still covered in abomination goo, is in the last classroom, writing along with the rest of the class.]

Eda: No! Why! School!

[Cut to the cafeteria, where Luz, back in the pot, is sitting at the end of a table with Willow and Gus.]

Gus: Hey. Do humans eat PB&J's?

Luz: Oh my gosh I haven't eaten real food in so long please give me some.

[Gus breaks the PB&J in half and gives Luz one. She takes the whole thing in her mouth and sinks back into the pot.]

Willow: I don't know, Gus. [grumbles] If Amity saw that...

Amity: [jumps onto the table] I saw that! Abominations don't eat! I know you're in there! You can't hide from me. What are you? Who are you? I want answers! [grabs Luz by her shirtfront and shakes her violently]

Abomination Teacher: Amity Blight.

Amity: [stops shaking Luz] Huh?

Abomination Teacher: I suspected a twinge of jealousy, but this, this is just sad.

Amity: But I‐‐ No! Look at it.

Luz: [groans as her head falls back]

Abomination Teacher: Report to Principal Bump's office.

Amity: But‐‐

Abomination Teacher: Now!

[Amity drops Luz and runs off. As the Abomination Teacher leaves, Luz pops back out, sharing a concerned look with Willow.]

[Cut to the outside of the Owl House, where King is tossing handfuls of dog treats to Prince Jr.]

King: Roll over! Yes! Heel!

[Prince Jr. did neither command, focused only on the treats. He now towers over King.]

King: Yes, yes!

[Prince Jr. roars. Eda returns.]

King: So, did you find your runaway student? By your expression, I can tell Luz has gone and found herself someplace else to learn. Which means I have won!

[Prince Jr. roars as he catches more treats.]

Eda: Yes, great, you won.

[King throws a handful of treats to the side. Prince Jr. chases them.]

Eda: You have a giant soldier thing and I have nothing. Congrats!

King: Oh, Eda. Don't say that. At least you have this! [He pulls out a shame cone and cackles.]

Eda: Ugh. [snatches it up and stalks off]

King: [laughing as Eda enters the shack attached to the Owl House] I am so funny! Ah, well, Prince, Jr. training complete. Go forth! Make the world tremble at your feet‐‐ or worm stubs.

[Prince Jr. doesn't move.]

King: Go forth?

[He still doesn't move.]

King: Oh. [chuckles] Right.

[He picks up the dog treat box and shakes it, but it's empty. Prince Jr. moves closer, growling.]

King: Ah!

[Cut to a classroom, where Luz is standing out of the pot.]

Luz: Whoo! I'm a sweaty little abomination. But now we don't have to worry about Amity. High five!

[Willow and Gus stare at her hand, then share a confused look. Gus shrugs.]

Luz: [demonstrating] Slap my hand. It's a human thing.

[Gus hesitantly gives her a high five. Then he does it several more times with growing confidence.]

Gus: Oh. Oh, my. Oh, man, what a rush!

[The classroom door opens, revealing Amity. She smirks and steps aside, allowing Principal Bump to enter the room.]

Principal Bump: Good afternoon, students.

Willow: Principal Bump.

[Luz drops, pretending to be an abomination. Principal Bump steps closer to her. Willow and Gus back off as he kneels down, turning her head.]

Principal Bump: Hmm. Abomination, rise.

[She does, looking nervous.]

Principal Bump: Abomination, lie.

Luz: Uh, viral fame is a worthy pursuit. Your cat would never eat you if it got the chance. Chemtrails are real‐‐

Principal Bump: Oh, no, abomination. How strange for it to get the command wrong. I mean lie down. [points to a desk]

Luz: [whimpers as she goes to lie down on it]

Principal Bump: So very lifelike. [approaches the table with Willow] When Miss Blight told me about your abomination, I had to come by, see what she's made of.

Willow: Oh, I have her list of ingredients right here.

Principal Bump: No. We were hoping... [pulls a dagger out of his sleeve] for a closer look. Willow, I'll allow you the first cut.

[Willow takes the offered dagger and smiles at him nervously. She steps closer to Luz.]

Willow: [quietly] Uh, you can't just cut open a human, can you?

Luz: [shakes her head]

Principal Bump: Willow, go ahead and make the first incision.

Gus: Wait, Principal Bump! Uh, high five!

[Gus knocks over three abomination pots. The goo spills together, and the formed abominations stand.]

Gus: Run!

[Willow and Luz run.]

Amity: They're getting away!

Principal Bump: No, the intruder won't get far.

[He approaches a wall and traces a large spell circle, then slams the wall in the center of it. Red light forms patterns on the walls and floor, spreading from the spell circle. Cut to Willow and Luz running through the halls, both panting as they stop at a corner.]

Luz: This is all my fault, Willow. I just wanted to see what a real magic school was like.

Willow: Well, how do you like it?

Luz: It's lovely, actually.

[Both giggle.]

Willow: Okay, we should get out of here before‐‐

[The red light patterns converge on the walls. When they reach a doorway, a red shield blocks it off. Several more doorways are blocked off, the patterns taking over the school.]

Willow: ...Bump seals us in.

[Cut to the inside of the Owl House's shack, where Eda is sulking in the shame hat. She looks up at King's voice.]

King: Help me, help me, help me!

[He runs in and slams the door, then dives into Eda's arms, whimpering. The door shudders under Prince Jr.'s attacks.]

Eda: [smirking] Trouble with your student?

King: Yes, yes!

[Banging on the door continues.]

Eda: Are you sure you need my help? Maybe he only wants more of your brilliant lessons.

[The door shatters as Prince Jr. bursts through and roars. He grabs King by the tail and drags him out of Eda's arms.]

King: [squeals] Please help me! You can call me Mr. Wiggles!

[Eda stands, removing the shame hat and grabbing her staff. She smacks Prince Jr. in the face with the butt of her staff, making it release King. Prince Jr. retreats as King clings to Eda's leg.]

King: [whimpers]

Eda: Okay, Mr. Wiggles. Here's what we're gonna do.

[Cut to Hexside. Willow and Luz reach the central atrium, but doorways are still being sealed off. Shadows fall over them. They turn and gasp. Bump is there, directing abominations toward them. They run a bit and hide behind a pillar.]

Willow: Oh, this is awful. [sinks to the ground] I don't know what to do. Amity's right. I'm just Half‐a‐Witch Willow.

Luz: You're Full‐Witch Willow. And you're great. And someone once told me great witches are resourceful. [pulls out the contents of her pockets.]

Willow: That's it! [takes the slime ball]

Luz: You mean that greasy slime ball?

Willow: Luz, it's a seed! Thank goodness you had it on you.

Luz: Yeah. Thank goodness someone told me to hold on to it.

Willow: [puts the seed in her lap and traces a spell circle over it] Please grow!

[Thorny vines grow from the seed, reaching to the ceiling. They stab through abominations and eventually target Principal Bump, sending him to the ceiling and pinning him there.]

Principal Bump: [gasps]

[Vines now cover the entire atrium, curled around pillars and reaching from the bottom most floor to the absolute ceiling. Pink petals fall from above, and several of the vines have flowers on them.]

Principal Bump: Remarkable.

[The lights sealing off the hallways fades.]

Luz: There's the exit!

[Willow puts the seed on the floor and follows Luz to the exit.]

Amity: [blocking the way] Not so fast!

[Both gasp.]

Amity: I'm not letting you get away so easily. I want my badge! Abominations, seize!

[An abomination comes from behind them. Luz punches it through the chest, then takes Willow's wrist and runs. Amity reforms the abomination and sends it after them again. Luz and Willow now seem to have a clear path to freedom, but another abomination forms in front of them.]

Willow: [screams]

Luz: Whoa!

[The abomination staggers forward. Willow traces out a large spell circle, causing vines to trap the abomination.]

Willow: Get outta here!

Luz: No! I'm not leaving you.

Willow: I may get detention, but you'll get dissected.

[The abominations from before melt through the vines, reforming and staggering toward the girls]

Willow: So go!

[She waves a hand, summoning two vines to carry Luz over the abomination and out the door. The door slams after the vines retreat.]

Luz: Willow! [sighs] I can't save you right now. But I know someone who can! [runs off]

[Cut to Eda fighting Prince Jr. It spits lava at her, which she easily dodges. She smacks it in the face with her staff, twice. It backs her toward the front door. Meanwhile, King is pushing a barrel on the roof.]

Eda: Pour the salt, now!

King: Baby boy!

[Prince Jr. looks up at King, whimpering. Then it roars.]

King: I have no son. Eat salt!

[He shoves the entire barrel full of salt into Prince Jr.'s mouth. It shivers and makes noises of protest, before shrinking back to its original size. It whimpers as it runs off.]

King: [dances] Yes, I did it! I'm amazing! Ahh!

[Eda catches him.]

King: [chuckles] You helped too. You are a good teacher.

Eda: I wish Luz thought that too.

Luz: [running toward them] Eda!

Eda: Hey, hey, hey, hey! What is this? [Luz hugs her and King] Ugh! I never understand when you do this.

Luz: Your lesson worked! Keeping junk in my pocket saved my life! [gasps] But wait. My new friends. They're in danger.

Willow: Luz!

[Willow and Gus hug Luz, who happily returns it.]

Eda: Seriously, what is that?

Willow: You won't believe it, Luz. Everything is perfect now!

Luz: It's true. I don't believe it.

Willow: Principal Bump was so impressed by my plant work he's switching me to the plant magic track! Look!

[She backs away and snaps her fingers. With a glow of green magic and a twirl, her sleeves and leggings go from magenta to green.]

Luz: [hugs Willow again] Yes!

Willow: [giggles]

Luz: Whoo! Oh. What about Amity?

Gus: Last we saw, she was asking Bump if today could count as extra credit.

Luz: Well, I can't wait to see you in action next time I sneak in. [Behind her, Willow winces.]

Gus: Uh, about that. You're kinda, sorta... banned.

[He pulls out and unfurls a poster reading "BANNED" with a picture of Luz covered in abomination goo under it.]

Eda: That's my girl!

Willow: But we could come here and teach you what we learned.

Luz: Aw. That would be nice. But... I have a pretty great teacher already.

Eda: Yeah, that's right. Luz is my student. [steals the poster] Back off, academy twerps.

[All laughing.]

Eda: Ah, baby's first wanted poster. Good job, kid. [pats the top of Luz's head] Looks like I taught you something after all.

Gus: Uh, you high five with your hands, not your head.

[ Confused on what she heard ending the episode]
