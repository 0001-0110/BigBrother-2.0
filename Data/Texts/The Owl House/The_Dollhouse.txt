[Luz jumps onto a couch and turns on the crystal ball TV.]
Tiny Nose: If you're looking for a dolly, come see me! [zooms out to Tiny Nose in front of her stand] Come on down to The Dollhouse! We got dollies for every occasion! And I assure you, they are definitely not cursed. There they are!
[Scene cuts to a doll standing on a rotating platform.]
Tiny Nose: [voiceover] Perfect gift for surprises! Graduations! Any happy occasions! Who wouldn't want to receive a definitely not cursed gift like this?
[The doll's head stops spinning and its eyes glows red. Whispers can be heard. Tiny Nose jumps onto the platform and pushes the doll aside.]
Tiny Nose: [frantically] Please, I'll do anything, take anything. Help me get rid of these dolls, I'll pay you! I promise they aren't cursed, I swear!
[A hand suddenly appears and presses on top of Tiny Nose's head. Tiny Nose gasps. Scene zooms out and up to a large doll behind the stand leaning forward towards Tiny Nose. It lets out a loud roar. Screen then cuts to black while Luz looks at the crystal ball with a puzzled expression. King opens the door and walks into the house.]
King: Luz! You won't believe what they are giving away at the market. [lifts up his arms holding 3 dolls] Henchmen!
[One of the dolls bear an eerily striking resemblance to Tiny Nose.]
The Doll: [whispers] Help me.
[Luz shows a cynical expression and takes out a dagger.]
