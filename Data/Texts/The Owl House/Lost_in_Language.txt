[Open on the Owl House living room, where Luz is reading from The Good Witch Azura 5 to King.]
Luz: 'Azura,' Hecate began. 'Our paths have crossed only in battle. But today I stand before you seeking an ally.' [sighs]
King: Luz, you're getting all swoony again.
Luz: I can't help it. Azura is able to befriend everyone. Even her biggest rival. I wish I had that kind of power.
King: Rivals are meant to be annihilated not befriended. Now keep reading. I've been sucked into your awful fandom.
Luz: Okay. Suddenly the door swung open.
Hooty: [swings the door open] Ding‐dong. Ding. Hoot! Hoot!
King: The book has come to life! Burn it!
[Luz goes to the door and finds a basket.]
Luz: Hmm?
[Cut to the kitchen.]
Luz: Eda, you got a package. It looks like a gift basket.
Eda: Probably an offering. Ah! Being the most powerful witch in the Boiling Isles has its perks.
[King, a bib now tied on, grunts as he pulls a blanket off the top of the basket, revealing a snoring baby bat.]
King: [rubbing his paws together] Mm. Fresh meat.
Luz: No, not eating that.
Eda: Witches eating babies is so 1693. What is this?
King: There's a note. [grabs it] Take care of my child till morning. Yi Yi.
Eda: Nope. Babies are awful. Not happening.
King: "You will be handsomely rewarded. X‐O‐X‐O‐X‐O‐X. Bat Queen."
Eda: Bat Queen?
[King pulls a few snails out of the basket. Eda's eyes widen.]
Eda: Reward?
Luz: Who's the Bat Queen?
[King sniffs the snails.]
Eda: She's the wealthiest demon on the Boiling Isles. Get in with her and you're set for life. [takes one of the snails] So, we keep this thing alive for a few hours and we get paid. Pfft. Easy.
Luz: Our greatest adventure yet! Learning about love and life through a child's eyes.
Eda: Not you. You have to return the books I checked out from the library.
[Eda summons a pile of books, which Luz catches.]
Eda: [to King] I don't want her getting a cut of the loot.
King: Good thinking.
Eda: Now, let's take a look at this little darling. [fully takes the blanket off]
Baby bat: [screeching]
Eda: Argh!
King: Oh, boy.
Eda: On second thought, maybe we could use your help!
Luz: [halfway out the door] Well, I better get to the library! Got to go! Bye! [closes the door]
Baby bat: [screeching continues]
Eda: We got this, right?
[The baby bat flies out of the basket and into Eda's face.]
Eda: Whoa! [audibly falls]
-THEME SONG-
[Cut to the streets of Bonesborough, where Luz is struggling to walk with her load. She passes Tiny Nose, carrying a book as big as Luz.]
Luz: Huh? Whoa.
[Watches Tiny Nose pass, nearly drops her books. She catches them and continues on for a few steps until she sees the library across the street.]
Luz: Whoa!
[Cut to the inside of the library as she enters. The book pile glows green and begins floating forward.]
Luz: Huh?
[Each book flies through a red spell circle.]
Librarian: Late.
[Beeps.]
Librarian: Late.
[Beeps.]
Librarian: [grabs the last book as Luz walks to the desk] Coffee, grass and bloodstains? These are Eda's, aren't they?
Luz: Huh. That was a crazy night.
Librarian: [sighs] I'll put them on her tab. [summons a scroll and writes on it] By the way, we're closing early for the Wailing Star meteor shower. [gestures to a framed picture of the Wailing Star]
Luz: Ooh. What's that?
Librarian: You're in a library. Read a book.
[His scroll rolls up and disappears.]
Luz: I am in a library. I will read a book. [runs off]
Librarian: Shh!
[Cut to a banner reading "Demon Decimal System DO NOT FEED." Luz rounds the corner and walks up to the growling card catalogues, feeding one a gum ball.]
Luz: Bloop.
[It gladly chews it for a few seconds before barfing up notecards. Cut to a study area, where several Hexside students are reading. Luz, standing on the balcony above them, grabs onto one of the dozens of books flying around.]
Luz: Wow! [screaming]
People: Shh!
Luz: [screams] Sorry!
[Cut to the reference section, where witches are watching things on crystal balls. One is watching a "HOW TO FLY" video, another is watching a piano cat parody, and a third is stuck on a loading screen, dial-up internet noises emitting from it. The last witch slaps the crystal ball a few times. Luz is watching them from around a bookshelf.]
Luz: This place is amazing.
Amity: [offscreen] 'What do you think you're doing?'
Luz: [gasps] I've been caught. Pretend to be a book. [poses]
[Kids giggling.]
Luz: Wait. [walks forward]
[Amity is reading to a group of baby-class students.]
Amity: 'We're your friends and we wanna help,' said the Tin Boy with a yelp. Otabin smiled and paced the floor. 'I've never had real friends before.'
Luz: Amity reading to kids?
[Luz sneaks into the kid's corner as Amity reads.]
Amity: 'Then we'll be your first,' the Chicken Witch clucked. Otabin couldn't believe his luck. So, Bookmaker Otabin surrounded by friends, bound a book of friendship and that's the end.
[She closes the book to applause from the kids.]
Luz: Amity seems so...nice and smiley. [gasps] Maybe I can befriend her like Azura befriended her rival. [grunts and ducks down as the kids leave]
Kid #1: Thank you so much.
[Laughing.]
Kid #2: Good‐bye.
Braxas: [hugging Amity's leg] Good‐bye, Miss Amity. Thank you.
Amity: [pats his head] Thank you, Braxas. See you next time.
Braxas: [runs off] Yay!
[Amity watches him go. She quickly looks to the side, then does a double take at Luz hiding under a book. Amity's normal attitude returns.]
Amity: Ugh! You.
Luz: Amity... [stands and leans on a book, making it fall] Whoop. Reading to kids. Wow. Looks like this sour lemon drop has a hidden sweet center.
Amity: It's for extra credit. [picks up the book Luz dropped] Don't get your leggings in a bunch. [walks to the back of the room]
Luz: [follows her] Hey, I could help with the kids. We could take turns reading. And do voices. I do the best [robotic tone] monster voice.
Amity: [slams her pile of books on a table] Human! [faces Luz] Do you see me going to the Owl Shack and bugging you while you... fry up owls? [scoffs] Okay, I don't really know what you do there, but every time you come near me, I get in trouble. Just leave me alone.
Luz: [backs up] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[Luz walks away. Amity starts to raise her hand to stop her, but doesn't.]
Luz: [groans and bumps her fist against her forehead] So much for befriending rivals.
Edric: [offscreen] You gonna let her get to you like that?
[Luz looks over and sees Edric and Emira. They walk up to her, Edric holding a rabbit lunch bag.]
Luz: Who are you?
Edric: Well‐wishers on a mission.
Emira: A noble quest.
Edric: Watch this. Hey, Mittens.
Amity: [grunts as her face turns bright red]
Edric: [holds up the lunch bag] Mom says stop forgetting your lunch. And stop being a jerk to your friend.
Amity: [stalks over and grabs the bag] She is not my friend.
[Luz looks down at the floor, but looks back up when Emira puts an arm around her.]
Emira: Yeah, makes sense. She seems too cool for you.
Luz: I am?
Amity: You can leave now. All of you. [walks back into the kid's corner]
Emira: [chuckles]
[Edric winks at Luz.]
Luz: [chuckles and blushes]
[Cut to the three of them walking around.]
Edric: So, you're the human we've heard so much about.
Emira: I'm Emira. And this is Edric. We're Amity's older siblings. We heard how you embarrassed her at the school and at the witch covention last week. No wonder she hates you.
Luz: I know. But, uh, I didn't mean any of it. I thought we were as cool as cucumbers. But we're as sour as pickles.
Emira: Don't waste your time with Mittens. Me and Ed, we're way more fun. Follow us.
[The three of them walk off, Luz looking down at where Emira is holding her wrist. Cut to a sign reading "<- FICTION NON-FICTION->". Edric wipes away the "NON" and hides as Gary, a second librarian walks up, leading patrons.]
Gary: And here we go towards our nonfiction section. [gasps when he sees the sign] Fiction, fiction? Is our world but fiction? Then what in my life is real anymore? [sobbing]
[Cut to where the librarian is reading while shelving books. As he puts one on the shelf, it glows blue and flies back onto the reshelving cart. This happens several times before Emira is revealed to be doing it, her, Edric, and Luz all laughing. Edric switches the places of the two librarians.]
Gary: Huh? No! Not again! [sobbing]
[The librarian falls off a ladder. Cut to Edric holding up a dusty book. He blows the dust at the demon decimal system, which all sneeze, showering the area with notecards.]
Luz: Whoo!
[They all laugh as Luz dances and the twins high five.]
Amity: Hey!
[Amity is standing next to the librarian, both of them with their arms crossed. He looks around.]
Librarian: [growls] Wait. Where's Gary?
Gary: [runs in] Coming. Nooo! [sobbing]
[Cut to the front entrance, where Luz and the twins are shoved out.]
All: Whoa!
Librarian: You've made reading far too fun. Now, stay out.
[The door slams shut. The three of them look at it for a second before laughing. Emira punches Luz's shoulder.]
Luz: Amity's even madder at me now. I didn't think that was possible.
Edric: No, when Mittens gets mad, she looks like this. [inhales sharply, grunting as his face turns red; exhales] Whoa, I almost passed out.
Emira: You're pretty fun, human.
[She and Edric nod at each other.]
Emira: So, hey, we're coming back tonight. There's a certain book we forgot to...check out.
Edric: And bonus, rumor has it the Wailing Star's supposed to unlock some rare magical event. You in, friend?
Luz: Sure.
Edric: Great. Meet back here at midnight. See you, Luz.
[The twins leave. Luz waves at them.]
Luz: Bye. This is great. First, I befriend the siblings then I befriend the Amity. [squeals and runs off]
[Amity is standing around the corner, likely having seen the whole thing. She holds her breath until her face turns red.]
Amity: [grunts] Phew! Almost passed out.
[Cut to the Owl House living room, where the baby bat is crying. King has pillows tied to his head and Eda has both her hands detached and plugging her ears while her arms are crossed.]
King: It's been hours. How can it keep screaming?
Eda: Ugh. I hate it too, pip‐squeak. [reattaches her hands] But think about the money.
[The crying continues. Three glass bottles shatter. The glass covering Eda's wanted poster cracks.]
King: No amount of snails is worth this torture. [falls to the floor] Make it stop.
Eda: [sighs] I can't believe I'm about to do this.
[She picks the bat up. It immediately stops crying. King and Eda both look at it in disbelief.]
Eda: Rock, rock. Maternal gesture.
[Luz enters the house.]
Luz: I just had the best day. Cool teens like me. Call me a library book 'cause they were checking me out.
[She looks over at the couch.]
Luz: Aw, Eda, you look so motherly.
Eda: Say that again and I steal your tongue.
Luz: [walks over] Aw. How can you say that around this cute little baby?
[Luz repeatedly pokes the baby bat. It wakes up and barfs out a smaller version of itself, as does that version. They all chirp and flap their wings.]
Luz: [recoils] Whoa!
[The bats fly upwards, still chirping. One of them breathes fire. Eda, King, and Luz all scream and run away from the couch, which is the unfortunate target. Luz runs for the door.]
Luz: [putting her messenger bag on] Parenting sure looks rewarding. E‐Enjoy your life lessons. Bye.
[She closes the door as she leaves. The bats fly around, knocking things off shelves and causing mayhem. Eda is holding King.]
King: Uh, for, for the money?
Eda: For the money. [yelps]
[She ducks out of the way of a green liquid that splashes the wall. Cut to the library that night, crickets chirping. Luz is pacing next to a pillar.]
Luz: Gotta be cool. [rests her arm on the pillar] Cool? [shakes her head and facepalms] No. [leans against the pillar] Cool. [grunts as she kneels down while throwing a peace sign; groans and drops her head]
Emira: Keep going.
Luz: Huh? [falls]
Emira: [leaning against the opposite pillar] This is fun to watch.
Edric: You ready to bring this whole, uh, whatever you're doing, inside?
Luz: [nods] Mm‐hmm‐mm‐hmm.
[They all approach the door.]
Edric: It says no trespassing but I'm allergic to the rules. [pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to Emira]
Emira: And dairy.
Edric: Wow, okay. Just expose me.
[The paper glows. Emira puts it against the lock on the door. The paper crumbles.]
Luz: Wow!
[The lock grows until it's large enough for them to walk through.]
Edric: Come on.
[The lock shrinks back down once they all enter. Cut to inside.]
Luz: Standing in a dimly lit lobby. You guys know how to party.
Edric: There. The Wailing Star!
[The Wailing Star sobs as it passes the stained glass window.]
Luz: Whoa.
[The three of them look around for several seconds as the books slowly begin glowing green.]
Edric: Hmm. Nothing happened.
Luz: Wait. [grabs a book titled "Extinct Birds of the Boiling Isles"] The books are all glowy.
[She opens the book. Almost immediately, something screeches as the birds in the book come to life. They fly around the lobby.]
Emira: Wow!
Edric: Wow. The Wailing Star magicked the books to life.
[Luz, still watching the birds, closes the book. The birds disappear. The three of them share a look, and then grins.]
[Cut to a magazine stand. Edric opens "Regal Couture", which dresses him and Emira in fancy clothing. A peacock flies out of it. Luz grabs "Witch Wares Weekly" and gets a giant sword, among other things. Luz yelps as she falls over.]
[Cut to the three of them standing next to the graphic novel section. Luz opens one.]
Luz: Nothing happened.
[Her words appear in a dialogue bubble. They all gasp when it appears, the twins taking steps back.]
Edric and Emira: Wow!
[That too comes out in a word bubble. Both pop when Luz closes the book, a "THUMP" sound bubble appearing as she does.]
[Cut to Luz holding "Snowballs, a History". She looks around a corner and sees Edric, holding the same book.]
Luz: Ha!
[She opens the book, pelting Edric with snowballs.]
Edric: [grunts, falls; opens book and returns fire] Ah!
Luz: Ah! [runs]
[She's safe for a second before Emira appears, opening yet another copy of "Snowballs, a History" directly in Luz's face.]
Luz: [yelps]
Emira: [giggles]
[Edric and Emira laugh as they run past the kid's corner. Luz stands from where she was hiding behind a shelf and notices "Otabin the Bookmaker", the book Amity had read to the kids, glowing on the table. She picks it up and opens it, and Otabin rises out of the pages. She smiles at him.]
[Cut to the Owl House, where a baby bat is holding a mace in its claws as it flies. Another pours a green potion out on the floor. A third is jumping on the turned-over couch, under which Eda and King are hiding. The first bat is now wearing another pair of Eda's shoes.]
King: What silences children? What if we invent a TV network for ages six to 11--
Eda: That's insane. Aah, there's only one way out of this. [reaches into her hair and pulls out a knife]
King: [gasps]
Eda: [cuts an apple] Apple slices and story time. [pulls out a copy of "Otabin"; sits on the couch] All right, brats. Let's do this. Ugh. Being parental is making me sick.
[The baby bats all sit on the floor. King joins them, holding the plate of apple slices. His pupils dilate as Eda opens the book and begins reading.]
Eda: "Otabin spend his days alone amongst the many books he'd sewn. With needle and thread..."
[Fade to Luz reading in the library.]
Luz: "...the pages he'd mend. But all the while he longed for a friend."
Otabin: [threading a needle] Friend?
Edric: Luz, check this out.
Emira: Look what we discovered.
[Emira opens a book called "Quacks Eats Snacks." A duck swims out of the pages and around the floor, quacking happily.]
Luz: Aw. Cute little quackster.
[Emira holds the book out to Edric, who has a pencil. He draws legs on the duck in the book. In the real world, the duck now has matching giant human legs. It quacks hysterically.]
Emira: Now he's extra cute. [closes the book]
Edric and Emira: [laughing]
Emira: Your turn, Luz.
Luz: [backing away from them] I don't know.
Edric: [offering his pencil] Come on. Don't stop the fun.
[Luz takes the pencil hesitantly and opens "Otabin." She looks at the drawing of him on the page.]
Luz: [sighs] I can't do it.
Edric: Let me help.
Luz: [grunts]
[Edric grabs Luz's hand and draws angry eyebrows and claws on Otabin. Something starts to rise out of the pages, but Luz slams it closed.]
Luz: [grunts] I don't wanna see it.
Emira: Whatever. We didn't come here just to doodle. Come on.
[Emira takes Luz's hand and leads the way. Luz drops the book face down. A clawed hand grows out of the book, and whatever it is growls.]
[Cut to the romance section.]
Luz: Oh, wow. Boiling Isles romance. That's totally lame. I mean, unless you guys are into it?
Edric: I think I'm into this one.
[Pulls a book titled "The Lone Witch & Secret Room". Something clicks. The bookshelf sinks back and slides away, revealing a secret room.]
Luz: Wow! That's a good book.
[Luz enters the room as the twins lean against the entrance.]
Luz: Your clubhouse is like my ultimate secret hideaway.
Edric: We don't hang out in a library. "Uh, teacher, I'm in love with a dictionary."
Emira: "I'm studying the dork arts." This is Amity's secret hideaway.
[Luz looks worried.]
Edric: Mittens has gotten too... full of herself. She keeps tattling on us when we cut class.
Emira: She needs to learn not to mess with people like that. So, we're going to find her diary.
Edric: And then post the pages all around school for everyone to see.
Edric and Emira: [laugh]
Luz: What? Isn't that taking it a bit too far?
Emira: No. See, we're her family. It's tough love. She needs to learn to lighten up.
[The twins start to look around.]
Luz: Hmm. Well, I‐‐ I don't see any diaries in here. [half-heartedly looks around] Nope, nothin'. Let's just leave. Wait, are those... [squeals] Good Witch Azura books one through four! You get these on the Boiling Isles? So majestic. [grabs a book] Is this cover hand‐drawn?
[The cover is of Amity dressed as Azura. Luz opens it, and a small version of Amity rises from the pages.]
Amity's Diary: I saw that... human girl again.
Luz: The diary.
Amity's Diary: I may have overreacted. I don't wanna come off as cruel. I just can't show weakness.
Luz: No. [closes it]
Edric: What've you got there, Luz?
Luz: [hides the diary behind her back] Oh. N‐Nothing. Just a Good Witch Azura 5 where she goes through her Goth phase.
[The diary glows blue and flies out of her hands.]
Luz: Huh? No, wait.
[Emira catches the diary and hands it to Edric, who opens it.]
Amity's Diary: It's not fair. I'm the only one who knows Ed and Em aren't perfect. Why do they keep getting away with things?
Edric: This is it.
Emira: Luz, were you hiding this from us?
Edric: You see how she treats people. How she treats you.
Luz: I know Amity can be kind of cold but no one deserves this. These are private thoughts. Let's put it back.
[Luz grabs the diary and pulls, but Edric doesn't let go. They both pull at it, Emira tugging Edric's waist.]
Edric: She needs this.
Luz: [grunts]
Emira: It's for her own good.
Luz: [grunts]
[Pages spill onto the floor, and Luz looks at them in concern.]
Amity's Diary: "I wish I had somewhere to go." "Why won't the human leave me alone?" "Called my teacher mom again." "Sorry I haven't written for a while. Wait, why am I apologizing?"
[The pages repeat themselves as Luz hurries to pick them all back up. Amity approaches the doorway as she is collecting them.]
Amity: Really?
Luz: Argh. It's not what it looks like.
Edric and Emira: [both giggling]
Amity: [mad] You two are the worst. [takes her diary from Luz, sounding hurt] But you... I've been trying to figure out what your deal is. Are, are you a poser? A nerd? I know. You're a bully, Luz. [runs off]
Luz: Amity! [starts going after her but stops]
Edric and Emira: [both laughing]
Emira: Mittens killed the fun.
Edric: Again. Oh, well. We're headed out to go goblin‐tipping. Wanna come?
Luz: You're just gonna leave?
Emira: Yeah, with you.
[Emira grabs Luz's wrist again. This time, she tugs her hand back.]
Luz: Look, you guys are cool.
Edric and Emira: [nod] Mm‐hmm.
Luz: But I need to go talk to Mittens. I mean, Amity.
Emira: All right. [winks] See you around, cutie.
[Her and Edric leave. Luz blushes, then runs off after Amity. Cut to a random aisle of books, where Amity is walking.]
Luz: [rounding the corner] Amity, wait.
Amity: First you embarrass me. Then you wanna be my friend? I don't get you. Pick a side.
Luz: Please, just listen to me.
Amity: Just go away before things somehow get worse.
[Loud footsteps.]
Luz: Huh?
[The monstrous form of Otabin created by Edric's drawing snarls as it steps into the aisle. His heart beats loudly, his book pulsing with it.]
Amity: Otabin?
Otabin: With claws and fangs and breaking bones, I found a friend to make my own. [grabs Amity]
Amity: [grunts] Luz! [screams]
Luz: Amity!
Amity: Luz!
Luz: Amity. Huh?
[Looks down at Amity's diary. Cut to Amity getting slammed against a giant book.]
Amity: [grunts, gasps]
[Otabin is holding a large needle, threaded with a giant ball of thread. He raises the needle and lowers it in Amity's direction.]
Amity: [yelps]
[He sews her arm into the book.]
Amity: Huh? [gasps] Why are you doing this? I've been reading you since I was a kid. I know you're not like this. Someone changed you.
Otabin: But friends are what I've always sought. And now a friend my claws have caught.
[A rumbling attracts both their attentions. A purple cloud rolls in, a figure in white robes and hat landing with it. The cloud blinds Otabin for a moment.]
Amity: [gasps] Azura?
Luz: [holding Amity's diary] Close. [pulls at the robes] Is a drawn okay? I kind of interpreted the descriptions.
Amity: Luz!
Luz: Ah, right. [writing in the diary] The good witch, Luzura, grabs her trusty staff. [a staff rises from the pages and she grabs it] All right, beloved work of children's fiction. Let go of her.
[She runs at Otabin, yelling and grunting while swinging the staff around theatrically. Otabin catches the staff before she even gets close enough to hit him and throws it behind him. He grabs the diary and gently closes it. Luz's Azura costume disappears.]
Luz: [chuckles nervously] Not an Azura fan, are you?
[Luz grunts as she's slammed into the page opposite of Amity's. Otabin sews one of her arms in.]
Otabin: Making friends, taking friends, never be without my friends.
Luz: You fiend. You can't rhyme friends with friends.
Amity: Great work, Luzura.
Luz: Hey! I was trying to save you.
Amity: Well, it doesn't matter. We're gonna be stuck together forever.
[Luz looks at her sewn in arm, numb. She moves it, the page going with it, and brightens back up.]
Luz: No, we aren't. Follow my lead. [slams her feet against the book] One.
Amity: What are you doing?
Luz: Two. Three.
[Amity and Luz both yell as the book goes down, hitting Otabin in the head. When he recovers, the book is gone.]
Otabin: [running after them] Come back!
[Cut to Luz and Amity running through the library, still sewn to the book. They duck behind a small shelf.]
Amity: [grunts] Now what?
Luz: I don't know. I didn't even think that would work. I was all like "roaaar."
Amity: [stares at her and chuckles]
[Luz grins. The moment is ruined when Otabin's needle pierces the page next to Luz's head and she yells.]
Otabin: Friends. [growls]
[He uses the needle and thread like a fishing line, pulling the book towards him. Amity and Luz both yell as the book is tugged over the shelf and onto the floor. Luz tries to tear at the string keeping her arm down. Amity grabs onto a ladder, then hooks her legs around it, pulling her arm free and launching her into a return cart.]
Amity: Luz!
Luz: Me!
[Otabin grabs the book and pulls it completely toward him. Luz tries to kick at his chest. Otabin grabs the needle and pulls it through.]
Otabin: You squirm and fight, and scream and shout. But friendship always will win out.
Luz: [whimpers as the rest of her limbs are tied down]
[The thread wraps around Luz's head. Otabin slowly pulls it tight, and Luz braces for it. Amity rides in on the book return cart.]
Otabin: [looking up] Huh?
Amity: [screams]
[Otabin is launched into a bookshelf, which falls on him. He struggles under it. Amity pulls the string keeping Luz down off the book.]
Luz: Oh. Third dimension how I've missed you.
Otabin: [shoves the bookshelf off of him] We must stay friends until the end. There is no tear I cannot mend.
Luz: Gulp.
[She yells as Otabin grabs her again. He wraps the thread around her.]
Amity: [gasps, pulls a pencil out of her pocket and writes in the giant book] "Luz has to right a wrong."
[A giant magic eraser rises out of the book. Amity catches it.]
Amity: Luz, quick. [tosses the eraser]
[Luz catches it and erases Edric's drawings on the page of the book. Otabin returns to normal, and everything falls to the floor. Luz catches Otabin and places him on his feet. Amity walks over and picks him up.]
Otabin: I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me.
Amity: Hey, it's okay. We're still friends.
[Amity nods to Luz, who closes the book. Otabin disappears, making Amity look sad. Luz walks over to her and grins.]
[Cut to morning as Luz and Amity leave the library.]
Luz: What an adventure. Thanks for helping clean up.
Amity: This never happened.
Luz: Wait. It doesn't make up for reading your diary but would you wanna borrow this? [holds out Azura 5] I noticed you only had up to four.
Amity: [takes it] Thank you. [starts to walk away, stops; sighs and turns around] Maybe you aren't a bully. I haven't exactly been the friendliest witch either. I'll think on that. [walks away]
[Luz grabs onto her messenger bag strap as she watches Amity leave. Cut to Luz entering the Owl House.]
Luz: Hi, guys. I'm...
[Everyone is asleep, snoring, on the green couch, Eda holding the baby bats and King on her lap.]
Luz: home. [smiles at them]
[The door bangs open.]
Hooty: Ding dong!
Luz: Hooty.
[A giant woman's head with bat wings crawls into the living room.]
Luz: Whoa. You must be Mama.
Bat Queen: Yi Yi. Mama is I. And I is the Bat Queen. [whistles]
[The baby bats fly away from Eda, settling into Bat Queen's hair.]
Bat Queen: Aah! Snuggle dumplings.
[She throws up a treasure chest, which opens to show several hundred snails. Bat Queen spits an Aztec death whistle on top of the snails.]
Bat Queen: For troubles. Eda is owed one.
[She squeezes back out of the doorway and flies away. Luz closes the door.]
Eda: [sleeptalking] Ah. Sweet babies. [wakes up] Babies? Where are the babies?
[Luz mimes flying away.]
Eda: Oh. And I just taught Junior how to pick locks too.
Luz: Your night looks very successful. Look at all that money you made. And look at this cool whistle that scary woman gave you. [spit drops off the whistle] I'd wash it before you use it.
Eda: Yeah. We did it all for the money.
King: I miss my babies. [hugs Eda]
Luz: I actually got you something from the library.
[She hands Eda a book titled "Coping with Empty Nest Syndrome".]
Eda: [chuckles] Thanks, kid. So, how was your night?
Luz: Good. Then bad. Then maybe good?
[Door squeaks.]
Hooty: Hey, you wanna hear about my night?
Luz: Ugh. No!
Eda: No!
King: That's not a thing anyone ever wants.
