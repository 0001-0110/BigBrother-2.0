[Open in the middle of a mystical forest, during a boiling rainstorm. A small, furry creature peeks out from a log when, then hides back in when a hooded stranger runs past. This stranger runs into a ruined building to seek shelter from the boiling rain and pull their hood down, revealing themself to be a younger Eda, with shorter ginger hair. She looks at her cape, annoyed that the rain had burnt holes in it. As she starts to walk further in, unbeknownst to her, a pair of glowing yellow eyes appear from a crevice within a pile of fallen rocks.]

[Eda wanders further into the ruins, past a cluster of stacked rock formations, when a shadowy figure runs past in the foreground, startling Eda.]

Young Eda: [brandishing her staff] Who's there? Reveal yourself!

[Cut to a perspective view from this mysterious figure, approaching Eda from behind. Eda turns around and gasps.]

-THEME SONG-

[In the present, Luz is at the Owl House. She is studying and experimenting with glyphs in a notebook.]

Luz: Hmmm...

[She starts drawing a glyph, but scribbles it out. She makes a frustrated grunt. King dives through, tumbling books over.]

King: Luz, I need your help! I think Francois is trying to start a rebellion.

[Pan to the couch, covered in King's plushies. Francois, his pale pink bunny, is sitting in the center on a pillow. After a beat, a jagged dagger with a red gem on the hilt falls out from behind him.]

Luz: In a minute, King. I'm getting so close to figuring out this glyph combo.

King: It's always glyphs and portals with you these days. What about King?

Luz: Why don't you ask Lilith for help? She was in the Emperor's Coven. She has more experience with unruly mobs than anyone.

[Lilith is kneeling at the desk, extremely focused on drawing a glyph with a red paintbrush. She's bent over, eyes only a short distance from the paper. Her hair is messy and the whites of her eyes are huge, with tiny irises.]

Lilith: [giggling giddily] Watching the ink dry is the best part.

[King grunts in disapproval.]

Hooty: [giving Lilith a mug] A fresh cup of tea for my favorite cup of tea. That's you, Lulu.

[Lilith smooths her hair, and her eyes are back to normal.]

Lilith: Well, Hootsifer, you truly are a gem. [pets his head] How do you always know what to do?

King: [whispering to Luz] What's going on? Is Hooty blackmailing her?

Luz: Oh, I think they're actually friends. Isn't that nice? [closes her book and stands up, holding a glyph] Okay, this will work for sure. Now you see me...

[Luz slams the glyph to her chest and vanishes. King gasps. Lilith looks up. Luz reappears.]

Luz: ...now you don't. Oh, I guess it only lasts as long as I hold my breath. Still pretty cool, huh?

[King rushes and clings to Luz's leg.]

King: Don't ever do that again!

[Lilith stands up in amazement.]

Lilith: Do that again! How ever did you accomplish it?

Luz: [shaking King off her leg] Well, since you guys discovered that we can make new spells by combining glyphs, I've been experimenting. I got the invisibility idea from your history books, Lilith.

[Lilith stands up and begins walking to the side.]

Lilith: Fascinating! As the lead historical scholar of the Emperor's Coven, my aid could be very helpful in--

[Lilith stumbles over the tower of King's plushies, toppling them.]

King: An ambush! Men, defend your ruler!

[King tosses a nearby plush at Lilith. Hooty blocks it, and dramatically falls into Lilith's arms.]

Hooty: I'm done for, Lulu.

Lilith: Hootsifer, this is make-believe.

Hooty: Ah, to die in your arms. Avenge me.

[Hooty droops and sticks his tongue out, his eyes becoming Xs (i.e. he plays dead). King tosses another plushie at Lilith's head.]

King: The King of Demons yields to no one!

Lilith: Historically, demons have never been united under a single rule until Belos. There's no such thing as a "King of Demons".

[King throws yet another plush at Lilith's head.]

King: Blasphemy! Clearly, you know nothing of my reign of terror. Allow me to tell you.

[Cut to a series of medieval-style illustrations depicting King as a large, fearsome King of Demons.]

King: [voiceover] I was once the mighty King of Demons. I was beloved almost as much as I was feared. But one dark day, an evil spell was cast...

[In one illustration, a giant green hand takes a large crown from King's head. Transition back to King, who falls to his knees.]

King: ...transforming me into this!

Hooty: Oh? What happened to your "crown of power"?

King: A trifle! That was just to test Eda and Luz's dedication to me! They passed. My real crown is still out there. But when I shrank, my memories got, uh... fuzzy.

Lilith: How convenient. A hole in your memory for each hole in your story.

Hooty: Nice one, Lulu! Up top!

[Lilith "high-fives" Hooty's face, giving him a black eye.]

King: Hey, I remember plenty!

[Back to the illustrations of a monstrous King, which depict what he describes.]

King: [voiceover] I remember armies bowing before me, being served the greatest of feasts...

[Cut to a POV shot of King's paw reaching for a bright light as it shrinks from view.]

King: ...and falling from a massive height as evil hex shrank me. One day, I'll return to my rightful place...

[Cut to a dramatic shot of King finishing his soliloquy.]

King: ...and all shall fear me!

[Luz grabs King and gives him a belly rub.]

Luz: [like talking to a puppy] Aw, you're gonna be such a good tyrant. Who's the scariest demon king? Who is it?

King: [laughing] Me! It's me!

Lilith: Your dedication to this farce would be charming if it wasn't so sad.

King: Don't blame me for your ignorance. I'm not a liar, and I can prove it.

[King storms off into a corridor.]

Lilith: [offended gasp] He called me ignorant. Me!

Luz: Stop it, you guys. This story is really important to him, so the least we can do is play along.

Lilith: You mean indulge his silly fantasy?

Hooty: Yeah! I'm a house of principles! You're asking me to lie? Hootrageous!

Luz: Could you please just go with it? For his sake?

[At the doorway, King is struggling to get back through with two long poles in his arms. They fall, and he holds them vertically and walks through. They're Eda and Lilith's staffs.]

King: All right, you two shall regret ever doubting me. We're going to my castle!

Luz: Uh...

Hooty: What's wrong, Luz? I thought you said we should just "go with"--

Luz: Go with him! I said we should go with him, right? How could I forget what I just said?

[Luz grabs Eda's staff off King, and Lilith takes her's.]

Lilith: My historical expertise is being questioned, and I will not allow it. Hooty, would you like to accompany us?

Hooty: [gasps] I-I'll get ready!

[Hooty stretches backwards toward the door. Cutting back to Luz, King, and Lilith, we hear sounds of crashing and squishing organs and splattering. The three all look disgusted and very disturbed until they gasp in horror. Cut to reveal that the part of the door where Hooty would be is now hollow, with pulsing organs at the edges. Below it, Hooty is now sitting in a birdhouse-shaped backpack.]

Hooty: Porta-Hooty, reporting for Hooty!

[Luz dry-retches. King is tearing up while slowly shaking his head. Lilith's hand is at her chest and she's taken aback.]

[Meanwhile, Eda gets out of a steamy bathroom wearing a bathrobe and a towel on her head while Luz, Lilith, King, and Hooty fly away on their staffs. She walks into the main room.]

Eda: Hmm? Where'd everyone go? Man, they made a mess in here. Oh well. It's been a while since I had room to put my feet up.

[Eda jumps on the couch and detaches her feet. Her head is on the armrest and she opens her eyes to see a note on King's plushies, reading...]

King: [voiceover] Off to my real castle! Don't wait up! Love, your favorite demon overlord.

Eda: Oh, no! Not again!

[Eda gets off the couch. Since her feet are detached, she simply falls.]

Eda: Oh!

[A dressed Eda gets out of the door, putting her feet back on, and heads into the shed. She emerges in her bathtub motorboat, flying it off a ledge and into the sea.]

[Cut to Luz (wearing her cape) and King flying over the sea on Eda's staff, while Lilith rides her's while wearing the Porta-Hooty on her back.]

Hooty: Are we still flying? It's been hours.

Lilith: Should we call it a day? Or perhaps a night? [laughing] Hooty, your sense of humor is infectious.

King: There it is!

[He points at an island slowly becoming clear in the fog. He steers Luz down towards it, and Lilith follows.]

Lilith: This island shouldn't be here. It's not on any of the maps.

King: It's always been there when I looked for it.

[They land on the shore and walk into the jungle.]

King: After I shrunk, I woke up here, in Eda's arms, and she carried me away. Like a wittle baby.

Luz: Awww...

[Luz grumpily gestures at Lilith and Hooty to follow.]

Lilith: [sighing] Fine. Aw.

Hooty: [gasps] Look!

[The fog clears to reveal a dilapidated tower.]

King: Ah, home sweet home.

[Cut to black.]

[Our heroes are trekking through the jungle, with King leading the way. King climbs over a tree root, with Luz and Lilith behind him.]

Lilith: That tower is certainly intriguing, but-- Oh!

[She trips over the root. Hooty extends himself to a nearby tree trunk to stabilize her.]

Lilith: Thank you, Hootsifer.

Hooty: [muffled] My pleasure.

Lilith: But couldn't we have landed a little closer?

King: The treetops are so thick, this is the only way in. Plus, now I can dramatically do..

[King grabs a bush obscuring the path. He pulls it aside, revealing a keyhole-shaped entrance to the tower.]

King: ...this!

Luz: Ooh. A door fit for a tyrant.

King: [chuckles] That's me!

[They walk toward the entrance, which is blocked by rocks. King climbs them.]

King: I'll find you guys another way in. Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle!

[King crawls into a crevice in the rock pile. Lilith walks over to a wall with a strange symbol caved into it.]

Lilith: Huh. What a strange material. And this symbol. I've never seen anything quite like this.

Hooty: Ha! I've seen better graffiti. I've got better graffiti on me.

[Hooty raises his side, showing "LUZ!" and three cool S's graffitied on him.]

Lilith: Luz, look! This predates any language I know. King's story may be a fake, but these ruins are a history mystery. [giggles]

[The rocks collapse, clearing the way. King peeks up.]

King: Eh? What's a mystery?

Luz: [laughing] The only mystery is how Lilith can be so smart and so wrong at the same time. Academics, am I right?

King: You so are. Come on in.

[Lilith give Luz a dirty look, and she sheepishly smiles back. The two climb over the rocks and into the tower. They use light glyphs to make their own lights and examine the room, which is littered with rocks stacked to make the same figure of something with two or three round rocks as a body and a crescent-shaped head placed horizontally.]

King: Ah, the chamber where I would devour the hearts of my foes. The taste was cold and bitter, but I bet yours would be sweet, Luz.

Luz: With all the sugar I eat, it better be.

[They all go forward. Luz notices a shadow resembling the rock figures passing behind her. She gasps, stops, and turns her light around. There's nobody there.]

King: Can't believe your eyes, huh? My castle does have that effect.

Luz: Yeah. [sheepish laugh] So much wonder.

[Lilith walks through a hallway. Hooty gasps and looks at a wall.]

Hooty: Are you seein' what I'm seein'?

[Lilith walks over to a wall, on which is a carving of a giant demon resembling King.]

Lilith: [gasps] These carvings, they're ancient.

Hooty: Wh-what does that mean?

Lilith: Well, if I've never heard about this ruin, let alone this entire island, who knows what other parts of history we scholars have missed?

Hooty: Are you saying...

Lilith: That he may actually have been...

Lilith and Hooty: The King of Demons?!

[Meanwhile, King is standing at the top of a pile of rocks, showing off to Luz.]

King: Ah, my kingdom. I, uh... [wipes a tear from his eye] I got some bone dust in my eye.

Luz: [looking up] What was up there?

[King also looks up. There's a hole in the ceiling with rocks plugging it.]

King: I-I can't quite recall. I just remember a muffled roar, probably some minion praising my name.

Luz: Well, uh... wanna head back? This is all so cool, but Eda's probably on her third cup of apple blood by now, and the last time, it was real hard getting her off the roof.

[Hooty knocks Luz to the ground.]

Hooty: Your Majesty! It's me, faithful ol' Hooty. You know I was messin' around with you the whole time, right?

Luz: [getting up] "Your Majesty"?

[Lilith pushes Luz aside again onto the ground.]

Lilith: It's clear these ruins are of immense historical value. Perhaps you could tell me more about them.

[Luz gets up and brushes herself off.]

King: [laughing] I suppose I could, uh, regale you with some tales.

[Luz hears something hissing in a dark corridor.]

King: Am I using that word right? Regale?

[Luz shines her light down the corridor and gasps.]

Luz: Uh, guys, are you hearing this?

King: I'll show you where my throne used to be. It was made from the teeth of my enemies and... [laughing] Boy, was it awkward to sit in.

[King leads Lilith and Hooty down another direction. Luz goes down the hallway by herself, and sees that the walls are lined with recesses containing stone figures, resembling the little ones in the foyer, partially covered in fleshy goop.]

Luz: What are these things?

[She stops by one figure with its "hand" sticking out. She groans in disgust and passes by.]

Luz: Just kidding. I'd never leave someone hanging. Up top, buddy.

[She high-fives it. It falls apart on her. On the ground, Luz looks up and sees countless other figures in recesses towards the ceiling. She shines her light and sees that one of them is empty. Suddenly, she hears hissing noise behind her. She turns and notices a figure running away. Luz chases after it.]

[Cut back to King, Lilith and Hooty.]

King: And that's how I would annihilate my enemies. Who needs due process, am I right?

Lilith: [gestured toward a wall carving] What does this image represent, my lord?

King: Uh, it's hard to remember. But that handsome devil looks familiar, huh?

[Luz approaches them.]

Luz: Tour's over! We gotta go! Now!

Lilith: But there's so much to learn.

Luz: This environment is not conducive to learning. It's conducive to death!

King: Ah, you saw the horrifying monstrosity room. Don't worry, they can't hurt you.

[The hissing is heard again. Everyone looks up and sees a fleshy rock monster, alive, crawling along the ceiling. It rotates its head down to look at them.]

Luz: That one can. Let's go!

[Luz grabs King and runs for the entrance, but the monster jumps in front of her and blocks her way. It changes its right arm into a claw and swipes at her. Lilith attacks it with ice magic, pinning it to a pile of rocks. All three start running.]

Luz: Dang, girl, you've been practicing!

Lilith: You may admire my progress when we get out of here alive!

[The monster slides through the ice spikes and gives chase, running along the walls and ceiling before again pouncing in front of Luz and Lilith. It stands tall, turns its head and changes its left arm into an axe. It prepares to strike, but an explosion at the head puts it on the ground. Eda jumps in from the rocks, wearing belts armed with explosive potions.]

Eda: Get out of here! [grabs a potion] I'll hold it back and meet you outside.

[She tosses a potion at the monster.]

Luz: Eda! We can fight it together!

Eda: You can't beat this thing. Go!

[Luz and Lilith look at each other, and they make haste for the exit. Eda grabs another potion from her belt and tosses it in her hand.]

Eda: It's been a while. Miss me?

[The monster leaps at Eda, turning the screen black.]

[Luz and Lilith run out, but stop and turn toward the entrance.]

Hooty: More running, less stopping!

Lilith: Edalyn said to wait here!

Luz: We can't let her fight it alone! We have to go back!

[Everyone hears explosions from within. They all look at the door with frightful anticipation, a terrified King clutching Luz. Eda walks out, clutching her a wound on her shoulder.]

Lilith: Edalyn!

[She runs up to Eda and holds her up.]

Lilith: You're hurt. What of that horrible creature?

[It climbs up and hisses, brandishing an axe-arm. It swings down on Eda and Lilith, but gets a blue forcefield appears the tower and the outside. The axe-arm goes limp on the outside, and the monster pulls it back inside.]

Eda: It can't get past the entrance. We're safe now.

Luz: That thing must be guarding this place against intruders.

King: But it's my castle. How could we be intruders?

Luz: Uh... u-um...

King: [starts wising up] You don't believe this is my castle.

[Luz looks the other way as sweat runs down her temple.]

King: Luz, you think I would lie to you?

Luz: King, I...

Eda: You aren't lying. You just don't know the truth.

[Eda groans and falls to her knees. Lilith starts bandaging her arm.]

Eda: It's time for me to tell you how we really met.

[A flashback begins, taking place on the island eight years ago. Boiling rain is falling; a younger Eda flies down on her staff and sets foot on the shore.]

Eda: [voiceover] Eight years ago I was looking for a place to hide from the Emperor’s Coven. I never knew this place existed and it just... appeared out of the mist. So, I landed.

[Young Eda looks at the holes the burning rain is making on her cloak, then notices the ruined tower in the distance.]

Eda: [voiceover] Now, I was one hot tamale, but the boiling rains were even hotter. I needed shelter.

[Cut to Young Eda entering the ruins, just like in the cold open.]

Eda: [voiceover] But when I found it... I wasn’t alone.

[She notices that shadowy figure running past her. She readies her staff.]

Young Eda: Who’s there? Reveal yourself!

[She turns around and gasps as she see what was trailing her. From behind a small rock formation, a small, furry creature with a skull mask on its head jumps out and wags its tail. It's King as a baby. The baby King tilts his head, and Eda lowers her staff. King then picks up a crescent-shaped rock and puts it on top of an incomplete figure.]

Young Eda: Did you make all these? What are you?

[She starts petting King, who happily wags his tail.]

Eda: [voiceover] I assumed you were just some stray dog. But then...

[The two look up and see the monster towering over them, brandishing its axe-hand. Young Eda grabs King and bolts, barely avoiding the axe swing.]

Eda: [voiceover] ...that thing was gonna kill us both, so I picked you up and bounced.

[Young Eda and King are fly out of the ruins. Approaching its magical boundary, the monster fashions its limbs into a bow-and-arrow and fires at them. The stone arrow hits King, breaking off his left horn and rendering him unconscious. Young Eda, having fallen off her staff, continues her escape on foot, grabbing King and his broken horn.]

[Cut to Eda looking sympathetically at the baby King as they fly away from the island.]

Eda: [voiceover] Against my better judgment, I took you home with me.

[Cut to a little later at the Owl House. Young Eda looks on as Baby King stacking piles of household objects, similar to the rocks in his castle.]

Eda: [voiceover] I’d gotten you the collar, ‘cause... well, that’s what you do when you get a new pet. But then...

[Young Eda looks on as Baby King stacks household objects upon one another, similar to the rocks in his castle. He completes one stack and stands proudly.]

Young Eda: [leans back on the door frame and snorts] Ah, look at you. A king amongst his subjects.

Baby King: King... King! [he falls down]

Young Eda: [surprised] It spoke. [to King] Yeah, that’s right. A king. [walks over and kneels down] You know what else kings do? They command armies and eat delicious feasts.

[Baby King claps and makes happy noises. Young Eda continues spinning kingly yarns to Baby King as he looks up with big, attentive eyes.]

Eda: [voiceover] And that’s how you got the idea you were some despotic overlord.

[Fade back to present, with Eda finishing her story.]

Eda: Oh, but you were finally happy. So I kept playing along with it.

King: [in disbelief] Y-You’re lying!

Eda: I’m not.

[Eda takes something out of her hair, revealing it to be the broken piece of King's horn. King is shocked and curious about this, and he slowly takes it from Eda's hand. He gasps, and the camera zooms into his eye, revealing forgotten moments of his life flashing before him.]

[Transition to a flashback of baby King in the temple, standing on a pile of rocks and presenting himself to his army of little rock figures.]

King: [voiceover] My army?

[Transition to another flashback, showing baby King grabbing a small insect and eating it.]

King: My feasts!

[Transition back to the present, with King still holding the peace of horn, looking devastated.]

King: My life...

[He looks down at the piece of horn, panics and throws it down.]

King: AAH! No! Keep that thing away from me! It's messing with my head!

[Luz extends her hand in sympathy.]

Luz: King, it's gonna be okay.

King: [despondent; panicking] Y-You're all just making fun of me, like usual, right? [hyperventilates] No! No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[King, now on the verge of tears, holds onto his head and breathes in sheer panic before running away from the group.]

King: [sobbing] No!

[Luz gets up and forlornly extends her hand as she watches King disappear into the jungle.]

Luz: KING!

[Cut to black. Resumes on Luz, Eda and Lilith walking through the jungle in search of the runaway King. Luz is trying to call for him.]

Luz: King?! Kiiiiing! Please, come back!

Lilith: I can't fly. The tree cover is too dense. I regret ever playing a part in this.

[Hooty, after looking sympathetic for a while, starts bawling.]

Hooty: Is this what regret feels like? I HATE IT!

[Hooty droops over Lilith's shoulder and continues crying. She gently pats him.]

Luz: I lied to him, even though I knew he trusted me. Now, he's all alone.

[Luz sits down and silently weeps.]

Eda: For now, let's split up. This island is small, and he's even smaller. He can't have gone far.

[Lilith and Hooty leave toward the right, while Eda kneels down to comfort a teary-eyed Luz.]

Eda: [assuredly] Don't worry. We'll find him.

[Eda leaves toward the left. Luz wipes her eyes, gets up and, with a determined look on her face, leaves to look for King.]

Luz: Kiiiiing? Kiiiiing?!

[Luz reaches the edge of the jungle and pauses. There, on the beach in front of her, is King, sitting alone on a log, staring out at the sea. A sympathetic Luz walks up to him and joins him on the log.]

King: [still upset] Eda was right, wasn't she? I was never king of anything. I'm nobody.

Luz: You are somebody. And I love that somebody very much. I'm sorry I lied about what I believed.

King: Everyone lied! And I was too caught up in the fantasy to realize it! [starts sobbing] I... I don't know what to do, Luz! [sniffles] I can't tell what's real and what's fake!

[King buries his face in his paws. Luz looks like she's about to start crying herself, but then looks up toward the ruined temple in the distance.]

Luz: Something's not adding up. One of your memories is falling, right?

King: [wiping his eyes] Probably another stupid thing I made up!

[At this point, King is acting doubtful]

Luz: No! What if that's a real memory?

King: Why does it matter?

Luz: You said you remember a roar from up in that shaft. Maybe that's what you fell from! Eda found you in those ruins. There's gotta be a clue in there about where you came from.

King: I don't know, Luz. What if the story gets worse?

Luz: You might have been alone before, but you have us now. Whatever we find up there won't change that. So, what do you say?

[Luz extends her hand. After a while, King gets up puts his paw in it.]

King: Okay.

[In the jungle, Luz leads King back to Eda and Lilith, both looking worried.]

Eda: [happily] King! You're alright!

[She runs toward King, but then stops upon noticing him looking sternly up at her.]

Eda: [sigh] You're mad at me. I get it. I would be, too. [kneels down] I'm so sorry, King.

[King suddenly pokes her on the cheek.]

King: Boop. No more secrets, okay? You have to promise me.

Eda: Only truths. I promise.

Luz: Great. Now, before we leave, we have one more thing to check out.

[She points toward the tower in the distance.]

[Inside the castle, the monster is maintaining one of the little rock statues when it suddenly reacts to something unseen. It hisses and looks back. It sees an exploding position being tossed and gets hit. Lilith flies in on her staff, aiming Hooty like a bazooka.]

Hooty: Special delivery... [deep voice] PAIN!

[Hooty fires a potion out of his mouth, and it hits the monster again. Suddenly, something invisible flies low past it. Luz takes a deep breath in, and she, King and Eda reappear on her staff, just like the glyph spell the showed off earlier.]

Eda: You sure they'll be alright?

[Eda stops, and Luz hops off the staff.]

Luz: Hooty knows what to do.

[Hooty is coughing up potions in a rapid-fire fashion, while Lilith is holding his head and looking disgusted.]

Eda: [to herself] Are you sure they'll be alright?

[While Lilith and Hooty are battling the monster, Eda flies up to the blocked hole in the ceiling. She sticks a potion into the rocks and jumps down toward Luz and King.]

Eda: Ready?

Luz: I always wanted to do something like this!

[Luz readies a glyph as Lilith and Hooty continue holding the monster off.]

Hooty: They're in place!

Lilith: Hold your breath!

[Lilith activates an invisibility glyph and they inhale, turning themselves invisible. The monster hisses and looks around confused before getting hit by the invisible Lilith. As Luz aims the glyph at the overhead potion, the monster grabs Lilith by the head, turning her visible again. Just then, Luz changes the paper into a fireball and flings it toward the potion. It hits, blowing the hole in the ceiling open. Hooty hits the monster with his face, freeing Lilith. She grabs her staff, and starts following Eda, Luz and King up the open hole.]

Luz: FLY, FLY, FLY!

[They start going up the hole, with Lilith producing a glyph to light the dark tunnel. The monster gives chase. Our heroes soon reach the end of the tunnel.]

Luz: There's...

King: There's...

[Zoom out to reveal that the tunnel has lead to a small, empty room covered in cobwebs.]

Eda: Nothing here!

[Everyone gets off the staffs and starts exploring. King hears hissing, looks down the hole and sees the monster coming in fast.]

King: [panicked] IT'S COMING!

[King shrieks and scats as the monster swipes its arm. It has the four cornered against a locked door. King backs into it, and his touch triggers a medical reaction.]

King: Huh?

[The door opens, causing everyone to fall backwards into a secret room. They hurriedly close the door as the monster reaches toward them, causing its goopy hand to get cut off. Everyone takes deep sighs of relief.]

Eda: Huh, I think we're safe... for now. But how did we get the door open?

King: Huh? [looks at his paw]

Lilith: [dumbstruck] This room is old. Very old.

[They begin exploring the room, which is decorated with decaying plants and a skylight on the ceiling. In the middle of the room is a golden pedestal. King walks up to it and sees the remains of a broken eggshell at the top.]

Luz: I knew there was something up here! I'm like the mystery whisperer. The butler did it, magnifying glass, secret door.

Lilith: It looks like that creature was made to guard whatever was in here.

Luz: King, does any of this feel familiar to you?

King: I'm not sure, but I think I know how to jog my memory. Eda, I'm ready. [extends his paw]

Eda: [worried] Are you sure?

King: I am.

[Eda take the broken piece of horn out of her hair and gives it to King, who places it on his stump. He gasps as his memories return to him, and the camera zooms into his eye. Cut to black.]

King: [voiceover] I remember a deep roar.

[Fade in on a flashback, showing an unborn King growing inside his egg. A demonic roar is heard from outside the shell.]

King: And then, something happened...

[The camera shakes to what sounds like an explosion. The unborn King reacts to the sound.]

King: ...but I was too small to do anything. So, I went back to sleep.

[Fade to black. Fade in again, this time to a more developed King inside the egg.]

King: And the next time I woke up...

[The eggshell starts to crack, and a slit of light shines through. King reacts to the light and reaches for it. Cut to the secret room, where King emerges from his egg and tumbles down the steps of the pedestal. The newborn King opens his eyes for the first time and sees the castle's mysterious symbol on the skylight. King then pulls himself across the room until he reaches the door. It magically reacts to his touch and opens, revealing the monster behind it. The two look at each other. The monster picks up King, cradles him and walks to the shaft. It dives down the hole with King in its arms, and King reaches for the light from the top as it disappears from view. Fade to black.]

[Cut back to the present. King takes the broken horn off his stump, a look of revelation on his face.]

Luz: King...

King: That roar. It meant "son". I don't know how I know that, but I do. Someone called me their son. Luz, I think it was my dad!

Luz: Maybe that was him on all those wall carvings.

[The monster breaks through the door down and prepares to strike with his axe-hand. As Luz cowers in fear, King defiantly runs up to it and raises his paw.]

King: Stop.

[The monster suddenly pauses, and it bows to him in respect.]

Eda: That thing was defending King from us this whole time? Huh. Alright.

[Lilith takes a picture of the wall carvings with an instant flash camera; the others look at her.]

Lilith: Oh, sorry. Were we discussing important revelations? I'll... [clears throat] I'll just... do this later.

[She takes the photo from the camera and sheepishly hides it behind her back. Hooty eats and swallows the camera.]

Hooty: Gulp!

Luz: [to King] Maybe you weren't exactly the King of Demons, but...

King: I was important to someone. [starts tearing up] If... If he's out there, I want to find him. I'm not that old! It could be possible! [sniff] Would you help me?

Luz: I'd do anything for you, buddy.

King: Then... can we keep him? [points to the monster]

Luz, Eda and Lilith: No!

[Hooty wraps his body around the girls, who are all disagreeing.]

Hooty: Yeeeees!

[Cut to the Owl House, where Luz is tucking King into bed while he carves the castle's symbol onto his collar medallion with a fork.]

Luz: Whatcha doin' there, King?

King: That symbol was all over that tower. What if it's my name?

[Luz glues the broken piece of King's horn onto the stump with glue, making it whole again. She wipes off some excess glue with her finger.]

King: Aah... gooey!

[The camera cuts to a wide shot of King's room, revealing the monster, which King had named "Jean-Luc", sitting lifelessly in the corner of his room.]

King: [put this collar back on] It's too bad Jean-Luc stopped moving outside the ruins. I liked having a big, scary minion.

[Luz looks at him and is creeped out by his presence.]

Luz: Yeah. Too bad.

King: Luz, is it okay to still call me "King"? It feels kind of weird when I'm not the king of anything.

Luz: Well, you'll always be the king of my heart. That's good enough, right?

King: [thinks for a moment] Yeah! Goodnight, Luz.

[King lies down, and Luz kisses him on the forehead.]

King: And Francois.

[King holds up his plush rabbit. Luz kisses it.]

King: Now, Jean-Luc.

[Luz looks at the inanimate Jean-Luc; some of his fleshy red goop drips onto his knee. Luz grunts in disgust and starts walking backwards towards the door while still facing King sheepishly.]

Luz: Bummer, looks like I'm all out of kisses. Maybe next time, goodnight! [closes the door]

[In the living room, Eda and Lilith are looking over the photos that Lilith took of the ruins.]

Eda: I've never seen markings like this.

[Lilith opens one of her books as Luz enters and sits down next to Eda.]

Eda: Hmmm... Ooh, is it some kind of ancient language?

Lilith: And those old carvings. Who were they depicting?

Eda: [to Luz] Any ideas, "mystery whisperer"?

[Luz picks up one of the photos.]

Luz: I don't know. But whatever we discover, we'll be there for King... no matter what.

[The camera focuses on the photo, which is of the carvings depicting the large, spear-wielding demon. Cut to black.]
