[The scene opens with an exterior shot of Blight Industries. Green smokes are coming out of the chimneys. We see a banner that says "PRIVATE SALE". Various hooded figures are seen entering the building. Edric and Emira are at the door. Edric puts a paper which says "HEX ME" on one of the hooded figure's back. The twins giggle. The scene then cuts to inside the factory. The hooded figures gather in front of a stage. Two hooded figures are standing on a stage. A light shines on them.]

Odalia: [grins] Welcome, valued investors, to our annual [takes off the hood] Blight Industries private sale!

[Alador takes off the hood, but trips while doing it.]

Odalia: If you're interested in reliable home security, we're here to help. [whispers] And, if you've got an enemy or two... Well, who are we to judge?

[The investors laugh. Odalia points at Alador.]

Odalia: This is my husband Alador Blight, the greatest abomination creator of the era. My name is Odalia, and as an oracle, I predict you'll love what we've got in store for you tonight. We are proud to present... the first glimpse of our crowning achievement.

[Odalia and Alador step aside, and up rises Amity with a dry expression on her face, and next to her is a strange abomination-like creature in armor.]

Odalia: The Abomaton Soldier!

[The investors clap. The scene cuts to the Abomaton pouring tea for Amity, doing her hair, and standing ready for a fight.]

Odalia: It will pour your tea! Help you keep up with the latest trends! And best of all, it will defend you against any unwanted visitors!

[Odalia touches her necklace which begins to glow; the jewel in Amity's necklace glows as well as she receives a telepathic message from it.]

Odalia: [through her necklace] Mama to Mittens, remember our deal: Make this look good, and we'll forgive your recent lackluster performance in school.

Amity: [sighs] Yes, mom.

[Abomaton tries to pound Amity but misses.]

Amity: [monotonic] Wow it's so fast and strong. Order now.

[Investors claps and cheers, Alador yawns. Abomaton grabs Amity.]

Amity: [monotonic] Oh no, it's undefeatable. How will I ever escape?

[A picture falls from Amity's sleeve. A closeup reveals it's the one of her, Luz, Willow and Gus from Grom Night.]

Amity: Huh?

[Abomaton almost steps on the picture. Amity gasps, then casts spell circle to destroy Abomaton.]

[Crowd gasps, murmurs.]

Random investor: That's awful.

[Crowd turns and start leaving.]

Odalia: Oh, of course, w-well that was but a beta test. We can't wait to see you all next week when reveal the uh... the finished product in all its glory!

Odalia: [turns towards Amity angrily] Amity! You just lost us a lot of money! What's with you lately?!

[Amity stares longingly at the picture.]

Odalia: I see. Looks like our precious mittens has been getting... distracted. (angry expression while thinking)

-THEME SONG-

[Hooty smashes his face into a steel bucket 3 times.]

Luz: [speaks while activating glyphs] Light in the darkness, a glittering bridge of ice, the mightiest tree in the forest! You can make all these, and more, with glyph magic! Welcome to day 3 of Luz's magic boot camp!

[Fire glyphs ignite on the ground. King, sleeping near one, screams and runs away when it goes off. Scene cuts to Lilith cheering and clapping while Eda is carving something into the desk she's using.]

Luz: Okay, we have covered every glyph I've learned up until now. So today, we'll learn something new.

Lilith: Are we about to encounter a never-before-seen glyph?

Luz: Un... fortunately no. These 4 either came from nature or another witch's spell. I- I don't know where to find more.

[Lilith and Eda stares at each other.]

Luz: In any case, today we're learning how to alter glyphs to do specific things!

Lilith: Miss teacher, did I do it right? [Holds up a diagram of ice glyphs]

Luz: Yeah! That's really good! [Lilith fist pumps.] Let's see how you're doing Eda.

[Eda has carved the fire and ice glyphs overlapping together on the table.]

Luz: I- I don't think that's such a good-

Eda: Double glyph combo, go!

[Eda slaps on the glyphs, they started flashing, then explode.]

Eda: Oh dang, I was hoping more of an ice blast situation.

Luz: I know you're impatient to get your powers back, but try to master the basics before you start experimenting.

Eda: Ugh, you're as boring as Lilith.

Hooty: Toot toot! The Hexside train is a-coming! Chugga-chugga! [grabs Luz by her collar]

Luz: Uh okay, uh, King's in charge while I'm gone. Bye!

[Hooty drags Luz away.]

King: Hahah, power!

Eda: Yes! Teacher's gone! Hah, I wonder what other combos I can try.

Lilith: Teacher said we're supposed to master the basics before-

Eda: Basics are so basic. Now if we want to be powerful again we're gonna have to start thinking outside the box!

Lilith: If we want to be powerful again, we have to use glyphs perfectly! And we can only do that through "memorization", "repetition" and "following the rules".

Eda: Well, I'm more interested in "experimentation", "innovation" and uh, "laughing at tools!" Like you! Hah! [walks away]

Lilith: Ugh! [stares down at King scratching himself]

King: Weh? Yeah yeah, I'll deal with it. [Walks off] No one ever said power came with responsibility...

[Scene cuts to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics exterior.]

Luz: Okay, first day back after the petrification ceremony. Just be chill.

[Luz pushes door open, and is seen by Willow and Gus. They run towards each other screaming happily.]

Luz: [tears up] Oh my gosh!

[The reunited trio hugs.]

Gus: [voice noticably deeper] Luz! You're okay!

Luz: [notices her friend is taller] Whoa, Gus! Did I uh, miss a birthday or something?

Gus: [shrugs] Witch puberty.

Luz: I can't thank you guys enough for helping me and Eda at the conformatorium.

Gus: That's cool, I just hope it helps Eda learn my name. She keeps calling me Goops.

Unknown student: Hey, Goops!

Gus: [dejected] It's already spreading...

Amity: Hey, Luz.

Luz: Amity!

Amity: In celebration of your return, I've brought you a homemade fairy pie.

Luz: Oh wow! That sounds so-

[Scene cuts to the fairy pie, which is filled with still alive screaming fairies.]

Luz: [disgusted expression] ...Gooood...

Amity: The ingredients are... very fresh. [looks away blushing]

Luz: Thank you. [takes the pie] You know, after everything that's happened, I'm just happy to return to some sense of normalcy.

[Sounds coming through school PA system.]

Principal Bump: You can't just barge in here!

Odalia: Yes we can. We are the Parent Creature Association. Luz Noceda, Willow Park and Augustus Porter, report to Principal Bump's office now! And you too, Amity.

Amity: [surprised] Mom?!

[Scene cuts to Principal Bump's office. Odalia and Alador flank Principal Bump while the kids are sitting in front of them.]

Odalia: The abomination situation, the destruction of detention, the rampage of grom. [Willow and Gus have looks of worry on their faces, Luz looks confused and Amity angrily looks to the side, arms crossed.] These are but a few of the incidents that have endangered Hexside students, including our daughter.

[Amity shoots her a glare.]

Odalia: So, the PCA has decided to... [notices Alador trying to touch Frewin's moving tail and clears her throat]

Alador: Oh, right. Um, these 3 are bad influences and must be executed.

[Amity, Luz, Willow and Gus gasp.]

Alador: Ahem, I mean expelled.

Luz and Gus: What?!

[Amity stares at her mother furiously.]

Odalia: [through Amity's necklace] Take this as a lesson mittens, a Blight always upholds their end of the deal.

[Amity gasps, then backs down with a dejected look.]

Principal Bump: Sadly, I have no choice in the matter. Luz, Willow, Augustus, effective immediately you are no longer students of Hexside.

Luz: No! But us... Good... Amity, tell them!

[Odalia stares at Amity sternly while Amity looks at her with a defeated expression.]

Odalia: Good. Now, you'll be taking double the classes to make up for lost time. Actually, I'm appalled that you're not in class right now. What are you thinking?

Amity: Right, sorry.

[Odalia snaps her finger. 2 Hexside guards barge in and drag Willow, Gus and Luz away.]

Gus: No, please! Wait wait wait...!!!

Luz: No wait, no! Amity! Amity!

[Odalia puts her hand on Amity's shoulder, while Amity glances back at Luz with a sad expression. The door closes.]

[Scene cuts to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics exterior.]

Gus: It finally happened! Our memorable adventures caught up to us. Oh, my dad can't find out about this! (picks up leaf) I guess I'll have to start surviving off the land.

[Gus attemps to lick the leaf but couldn't bring himself to do it.]

Gus: Ah! This is impossible! [runs away crying]

Willow: [hugs a tree] I guess this is goodbye. I'll water you one last time... with my tears!

[Luz groans. She notices Alador and Odalia coming out of school and descending down the steps.]

Luz: Hey!

[Odalia glances back.]

Luz: How dare you mess with my friends' lives! What have we ever done to you?

Odalia: Luz, was it? Please, this isn't personal. I actually appreciate your tenacity. We're just trying to teach our daughter a valuable lesson in business.

Luz: How does this teach anything? We're still gonna be friends with her. I'm calling applesauce on this business baloney!

Odalia: Your human language is hard to understand, but I think I see your point. [grabs and squeezes the butterfly Alador is chasing and releases it] If you're interested in talking things through, I'm sure we can come to some sort of an agreement. [hands Luz a Blight Industry business card]

Gus: Gus chomp! [munches on the card]

Willow: Come on Luz, we can figure this out on our own.

Gus: [spits out the card] That's right, we'll get back into Hexside or die trying!

Willow: No one's dying.

Gus: Not with that attitude.

[Willow and Gus turn and walk away.]

Odalia: [chuckles] Yes well, when that doesn't work, you know where to find us.

[Odalia pushes Alador and they walk away together.]

[Scene cuts back to inside the Owl House. Eda is seen making a card pyramid.]

Eda: Okay, almost got it... Glyph pyramid!

King: And what are you expecting this glyph pyramid to do?

Eda: It's supposed to prove that I'm the superior witch. Watch and learn.

[Eda slaps on the card pyramid but fails to do anything impressive.]

Eda: Ugh, okay let's think. Bile sacs have different spell phlegm sloshing around together. So why can't I mix these up too?!

King: But those are disgusting liquids, these are symbols from the isles. Maybe there's a different way to combine them.

Eda: Hmmm...

Hooty: [outside] Hootly-mootly!

[Eda looks outside the window.]

[Lilith creates an ice crown using glyph combo and puts it atop Hooty's head.]

Hooty: Ohhh!!!

[Eda looks with a jealous expression.]

[Lilith makes 2 popsicles using glyph combos and offers Hooty one.]

Hooty: Ohhh!!! [munches on popsicle] Ummm!!!

[Lilith creates a swan Hooty ice sculpture using glyph combo.]

Hooty: Whoahahaha!!! I bet even Eda couldn't do that! Wow!

[Eda growls angrily.]

King: Maybe if you just learn the basics like Luz said-

Eda: I don't have time for basics. I'm on to something, and I'll prove it!

[Eda cracks her knuckles and starts drawing something on a notepad.]

[Scene cuts back to 3 posters showing that Willow, Luz and Gus are banned from Hexside.]

Luz: Operation Change Bump's Mind. Let's go!

[Scene cuts to Principal Bump looking at pictures of him and the trio taken during grom night with a sad expression. Someone knocks on the window, there's a basket from the trio with a note pleading Principal Bump to un-expel them, a drawing of him, and a disfigured cake which is supposed to resemble his face. Principal Bump gets spooked by the cake and throws it down, hitting the trio on the head. The trio then try to enter by pretending to be Hexside teachers using Gus' illusion magic, but bump into Principal Bump and the teachers outside. Principal Bump breaks their illusion spell and the trio backs off. Principal Bump turns and walks away with tears. The trio then try to fly inside using Eda's staff, but backs off when Principal Bump points a crossbow at them. ]

Principal Bump: [cries] Life is just so dull without them! [continues crying]

[The Hexside guards close the main door.]

Gus: Ah, this is hopeless! Nothing is working!

Luz: Don't worry guys, as long as we stick together we'll think of something!

[A crow phone crows and lands atop Willow's head.]

Willow: Oh no.

Gilbert: [from the phone] Willow Park, did you get expelled?!

[Another crow phone lands atop Gus' head.]

Perry: [from the phone] This is Perry Porter with breaking news. In light of recent events, Augustus Porter will be grounded for no less than a year.

[Crow phone grabs Gus by his collar and starts flying up.]

Gus: Help Luz! Let me go! No please, no!

Gilbert: Just one? Willow's grounded for three at least!

[The 2 crow phones grab Willow and Gus and fly away.]

Willow: No, ah! Help, Luz! Help, Luz!!!

Gus: Luz! Save me!!!

[Amity passes Luz from behind and accidentally drops her book. Luz hears it and turns back toward the source of sound. Amity notices Luz.]

Amity: I'm uh... I'm sorry, I was a coward in there. But my mom-

Luz: Hey, I get it. You're scared of her, but I'm not, and I need you to take me her. She seemed open to talking things through.

Amity: No, no, Luz, you don't have to do that.

Luz: Yes, I do. Willow and Gus don't deserve this. [picks up Amity's book] So, will you help me, please?

Amity: I... I can't.

[School bell rings.]

Amity: I have to go. [takes book from Luz, turns around and walks away]

[Luz turns around and walks away sadly, but accidentally steps on the business card thrown on the floor. She picks it up and notices the address written behind the card.]

[Scene cuts back to inside the Owl House.]

King: Eda, wh- what the heck is that supposed to be?

Eda: I call it "the super glyph!"

King: More like, a stupid glyph.

Eda: Just you wait, this'll be a killer combo. Lesser glyphs will shrink in fear.

[Eda taps on the glyph and it turns into an ice cube.]

Eda: Hah! It didn't blow up!

[The ice cube sparkles and turns into a blob of ice which looks like a turtle shell with spikes.]

King: Uh, i- is it supposed to do that?

[The ice blob suddenly expands, causing Eda and King to yelp in surprise and run away. It continues to expand, trapping and freezing various objects inside it.]

Eda: Uh-huh...

[Scene cuts to outside Blight Manor. Luz picks some flowers from beside the front door, then walks up and knocks on the door.]

Luz: Hello Mrs. Blight, I-

[An abomination butler opens the door and grunts.]

Luz: Ooh.

[The abomination butler leads Luz into the living room while holding a tray with teacup and teapot on it.]

Luz: Ooh, this place smells a lot better than the Owl House.

[The abomination butler offers Luz some tea, but Luz decides to give his face a makeover instead.]

Luz: And...! [turns the abomination butler's face into a kitty face, but it melts immediately]

Luz: [laughs] Well, I tried. [opens door and walks down the basement] Hello? Mr. and Mrs. Blight?

[A severed abomination hand is thrown into the wall beside Luz.]

Luz: Eek!

Odalia: Oh don't mind him dear, he's getting ready for our big demonstration tonight. It's looking good hon!

[Alador grunts and tears something off.]

Luz: I'm here to appeal to your hearts, Blights!

Odalia: That's sweet, but let's get to the deal. We have a rather important presentation tonight showing off some new products.

Luz: Like, abominations?

Odalia: Something like that. Normally Amity helps us with these things, but she's busy catching up on schoolwork.

Luz: I get it. I'll help you show off your weird abomination gunk if you promise to let me and my friends back into school.

Odalia: Don't worry human, a Blight always upholds their end of the deal. Now, you might want to go get ready, because we have...

[Scene focuses on Luz's face while the surrounding transitions from the basement into the Blight Industry product event.]

Odalia: ... a long night ahead of us folks! Welcome back to Blight Industries!

[Crowd applauds and cheers. Luz chuckles nervously with a worried expression on her face.]

[Scene cuts to Blight Industries exterior then back to the product event.]

Luz: So, Alador, what would you say is the specialty of Blight Industries?

Alador: We make a variety of abomination-based accessories for home security.

Luz: Oh, that sounds pretty safe!

Alador: But we specialize in weaponry. [walks away] You might want to duck.

Luz: Huh? [a lump of clay hits her, pinning her to the wall] Whoa!

[Crowd cheers and applauds.]

Odalia: Yes, our sticky launcher can peacefully subdue any foe! And, if peaceful isn't your thing...

[Odalia switches modes on the gun and turns it into a flamethrower. Crowd cheers and applauds. Luz gasps.]

[Scene cuts back to Blight Manor's living room. Amity walks in, removing her cowl.]

Amity: Mom? I'm ready for the show tonight!

[Amity notices a note and takes it down to read it. On the note it says: "We found a replacement! -Mom"]

Amity: We found a replacement? [turns around and asks the abomination butler] Did anyone come to the house today?

[Amity notices the butler's disfigured face that somewhat resembles a cat, and growls angrily, knowing it was Luz.]

[Scene cuts to Willow's room. Willow is sitting and looking down with a sad expression as her father drops a pile of textbooks on her desk.]

Gilbert: To make sure you're getting a top-notch education, we're quitting our jobs to homeschool you.

Mr. Park: And we'll spend all our free time having fun as a family.

Gilbert: See you at first light for a test on the uh- [looks at the book he picked up] life cycle of a common swamp toad! [closes door]

[Willow continues to look down sadly, but an illusion of a tiny Gus appears.]

Gus illusion: Willow! Hey, Willow! [points at window]

[Willow gasps, then walks towards the window. Mr. Park opens the door, causing Willow to gasp again.]

Mr. Park: Hey Willow, uh-

[Mr. Park notices the tiny Gus illusion, then looks at Willow who is heading towards window. He smiles, puts a finger on his mouth, makes a "shhh" sound then closes the door. Willow smiles, then turns around and opens the window. Gus and Amity are standing outside below.]

Amity: Luz needs our help!

Gus: [annoyed] Again.

[Scene cuts back to Blight Industries exterior. Crowds can be heard cheering and applauding while Luz's terrified screaming is also heard. Gus, Willow and Amity are standing outside thinking how to get in.]

Willow: Okay, I can use the root system underground to tunnel our way in.

Amity: That'll take too long. We should just rush the guards at the door!

Gus: No no no, I'll distract them with illusions of beautiful lady guards.

Willow: This isn't a cartoon from the '40s, Gus! We need a better plan!

Gus: This could work!

Amity: We should just bust our way through!

Gus: You're stunting my growth as an artist! Just let me try this!

Willow: We are running out of time! We gotta get in now!

Amity: We have to help Luz now!

Edric: Here's an idea.

[Gus, Willow and Amity look toward the sound.]

Edric: Why don't you just walk through the front? [throws each of them a cloak]

Amity: Ed! Em! You're helping?

Emira: Of course! Just... don't tell Mom.

[The trio put on their cloak and walk inside. Edric puts paper which says "Hex me!" on their back. The twins laugh at this, but Amity throws them back and they hit Edric in the face.]

Edric: Ahhh! Ugh!

[Amity points 2 fingers at the twins and walks backwards, growling.]

[Scene cuts to inside the factory. The trio runs inside into an excited crowd cheering and clapping while Luz is busy trying to get away from the Abomaton's attack.]

Luz: [pants] Ah! [ducks attack] Whoa! [ducks attack again]

[Luz uses ice glyph magic to block Abomaton's attack, but the arrow breaks the ice block, pushing Luz backwards. An abomination fist punches Luz upwards, Luz screams, and the hand catches her when she falls down. Crowd continues cheering and applauding. The Abomaton points the bow at Luz while Luz grunts and closes her eyes, waiting for the incoming attack.]

Odalia: Thank you, thank you. And they say said we couldn't make crossbows more fun! Next, we're very excited to show you our last product from this line.

Luz: [sigh of relief] Oh my goodness, only one more to go.

Odalia: My husband has been toiling to bring you...

[Odalia steps aside, the ground opens up and Luz yelps and crawls away. An Abomaton rises up.]

Odalia: THE ABOMATON 2.0!

[The crowd gasps. So does Amity; she takes off her hood then turns around and starts climbing up a ladder.]

Willow: Amity, wait!

[Gus and Willow take off their hood, but immediately gets grabbed by security abominations.]

Odalia: It's bigger! It's better! The Abomaton 2.0 is the perfect soldier. It won't rest until its enemy is completely eliminated!

[Crowd oohs and a few of them claps.]

Luz: [laughs nervously] You're a big boy, aren't ya?

[The Abomaton's hands turns into weapons. Luz makes a scared noise and looks at the abomaton with a terrified expression. The Abomaton starts attacking Luz, and manages to grab Luz by her foot.]

Luz: Okay! It's super strong! I think the crowd gets it!

Alador: She has a point, Odalia.

Odalia: Didn't you hear me? It won't rest until its enemy is completely eliminated!

[The Abomaton lifts Luz up by her foot, Luz screams and is thrown upwards. Luz lands on a beam.]

Luz: Okay, at least you can't get me up here...

[The Abomaton flies up and lands behind Luz.]

Luz: Luz, you fool!

[Luz uses an ice glyph to block the Abomaton. The Abomaton breaks it. Luz picks up a piece of shattered ice and use it as a sword to fight off the Abomaton.]

[Amity is seen climbing up a ladder while Luz keeps on fighting the Abomaton. She uses plant magic to lift herself up then swings around towards the Abomaton with a fire glyph just as it firesvanother blast. An explosion happens. The abomaton falls to the ground, breaking the floor. The crowd runs away. Luz is hanging onto a vine for dear life with her eyes shut. She opens her eyes and notices that she is facing the Abomaton and is close to the ground. The vine breaks.]

Luz: Ah! [lands] Hey! I'm alive!

[The Abomaton grabs Luz by her foot again.]

Luz: Oh, no.

[The Abomaton's hand turns into an axe and swings at Luz.]

Luz: I'm dead! [closes her eyes, waiting for inevitable death, but something stops the Abomaton] Huh?

[The Abomaton's hands explode.]

Amity: HEY!

[Crowd gasps, Amity is seen standing on a beam.]

Amity: STAY AWAY FROM MY LUZ! [casts spell circles]

Luz: [looks at Amity with a surprised expression] Amity?

[Scene cuts to the Owl House exterior. Hooty is wearing an ice crown and ice chain necklace with a popsicle in his mouth. He is looking at Lilith drawing something on a notepad. A sudden loud noise and vibration grabs their attention.]

Lilith: [knocks on door] Edalyn? Are these distressed noises or normal noises?

[The ice blob is seen expanding slowly.]

Eda: Totally normal! Don't come in! [looks at the blob] I am your mother! You will obey me and die!

[Eda hits the ice blob with a mace, but the mace is absorbed by the blob and Eda is pushed away by a spike.]

Eda: Ugh!

King: Eda, help me! Help me, Eda! Eda, HELP ME!!!

[King is frozen inside the blob.]

Eda: [gasps with a horrified expression] Ugh, fine! Lilith, emergency!

[Lilith kicks open the door.]

Lilith: Whoa.

Eda: Yeah yeah, I messed up. I'm ready to follow the rules.

Lilith: Actually, I'd like to try an experiment. [holds a few pieces of paper in her hands]

Hooty: Hoooot! [shakes his neck]

[Scene cuts back to inside Blight Industries. Amity slides down a rope and faces the Abomaton.]

Amity: Huh-uh! [lands]

Odalia: [uses her necklace] Amity Blight, you are in so much troub-

[Amity takes off and breaks her necklace. Odalia gasps.]

Amity: Luz, [looks back] are you okay?

Luz: [looks at Amity with an amazed expression, blushing] Uh-huh. [gasps] Look out!

[Amity's spell circle disappears, the Abomaton stands up and tries to punch Amity, but Amity holds him back with her spell circles with all her might. The Abomaton's hands start melting.]

Odalia: [angrily] Amity! Get away from the human!

Amity: No, you're gonna listen to me for once. Luz, Gus and Willow are my friends! [pushes the Abomaton backwards] They're nice to each other, they listen to each other. They make me think about the kind of person I really WANT TO BE!!!

[Amity forces the Abomaton to kneel down. Luz runs towards Amity and they stand together back-to-back. They accidentally glanced at each other and immediately look away, both blushing with an awkward expression. Odalia looks at the "units ordered" meter angrily as Alador appears to be intrigued by the turn of events.]

Odalia: Ugh! What do you want?!

Amity: Let my friends back into Hexside, or else your precious investors will watch me rip this thing apart bit. By. Bit.

Luz: [whispers] Can you actually do that?

Amity: Shhh!

[Crowd boos.]

Random investor 1: Come on!

Random investor 2: This is horrible!

[Odalia looks at the "units ordered" meter in frustruation.]

Odalia: [groans] Fine! It's a deal! Just stop with the theatrics!

[Luz and Amity glance at each other and smile. Amity stops using her spell circles. The Abomaton's hand changes into a large hammer and brings it down towards the duo. Amity rushes over to protect Luz. The Abomaton's hammer pounds right where the duo are. The Abomaton lifts up the hammer. The duo is seen pretending to have died. The Abomaton's hammer is revealed to be hollow in the middle and it transforms back to a normal hand. The duo open their eyes, look at each other and smile, then go back to pretend dying.]

[The Abomaton's eyes go dark. The crowd gasps. The Abomaton shuts down.]

[Crowd cheers and applauds.]

Willow: Luz!

[Willow and Gus run towards Amity and Luz with worried expressions. The "units ordered" meter goes up so high it explodes. Odalia looks at Amity and Luz angrily.]

Odalia: [growls] As if I'd actually let them go back! I will call every authority I know! I'll make sure they can't-

Alador: Odalia!

[Odalia turns towards Alador.]

Alador: You made a deal with your daughter, and a Blight always upholds their end of the deal.

[Scene cuts to Willow helping Luz get up. Willow, Luz, Gus and Amity walk away together.]

Alador: Besides, she's getting stronger. [puts hands on Odalia's shoulder] Strong enough to become a coven head someday.

Odalia: [grins] Wise words, dear. We have to focus on what's best for the family-

[Odalia turns around and notices Alador gone. She glances to her left and notices Alador chasing a butterfly.]

Odalia: Alador! [groans and facepalms]

[Scene cuts back to inside the Owl House. Both Lilith and Eda are drawing something on their paper respectively. King has a towel wrapped around his head and is holding a cup in his hands.]

King: Ah-choo!

Eda: Okay so, uh, how did you beat that thing again?

Lilith: [smugly] Would you like me to lay out the basics?

Eda: [stares at Lilith unhappily] Yes.

[Scene flashes back to Lilith and Eda watching King freezing inside the ice blob.]

Lilith: Well, you were right. These glyphs act like the basic elements. But, instead of containing like we do, they command the magic around them. They're like words! And drawing glyphs on top of each other like you did-

Eda: Was like screaming 3 different words at the same time! The spell got confused!

Lilith: Yes. The glyph combo, copyright me, Lilith, helps organize the commands...

[Lilith slaps a paper with a glyph combo on it onto the ice blob. The ice blob flashes, then melts.]

Lilith: ... so you can combine and specify what you want to do!

King: [shivers] A-a-b-b-bout t-t-time!!!

[Eda catches some snow in her hand and looks up above at the snow in wonder. Scene flashes back to the present.]

Eda: So with the right combo, you can cast any spell!

King: Maybe the reason Luz hasn't found any more glyphs is because there... aren't any more.

Eda: Then we better start learning some new combinations.

[Sound of door being pushed open and hitting something.]

Luz: Hey guys! [wipes off abomination gunk of her hair]

Eda: Hey Luz! We actually learned something new!

Luz: Sorry, can it wait 'till morning? [tired expression] I need to lie down.

Lilith: Wait, Miss Teacher!

[Lilith turns to her left then turns back holding an ice sculpture. The sculpture is of her kneeling before Luz, who's being depicted as a wise scholar holding a scroll.]

Lilith: Do I get extra credit?

Luz: [amused] Oh, my gosh!

Eda: [stares jealously] I can do it too.

[Eda slaps on a paper with ice glyph drawn on it. The glyph turns into and ice cube and rolls off the table.]

Eda: Hmm. [looks at Luz and gestures towards the ice cube]

Luz: [amazed] Wow! Yeah! Extra credit for everyone!

[Luz throws 2 pieces of star-shaped paper to Lilith and Eda then walks away. Lilith catches one and holds it to her face gratefully while Eda and King just stare at her.]

King: Ah-choo!

[Scene cuts back to inside the Blight Industries factory. The abomination servants are sweeping the floor. Odalia walks towards Alador.]

Odalia: Oh despite the spectacle, this was quite a successful sale! Excellent job on the 2.0, dear.

Golden Guard: Yes! [walks in with 2 coven scouts] Your abomatons are quite extraordinary. Too bad no one will be receiving them.
