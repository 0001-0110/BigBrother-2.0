[Scene opens with Luz inside her room at the Owl House. She is sitting on the floor going through different books. She then notices her Echo Mouse running on a running wheel.]

Luz: [sighs] You and me both, buddy. I can't figure out what I messed up when I made that ding-danged door.

[Luz is suddenly distracted by a clinking sound. Downstairs, Hooty is throwing a party.]

Hooty: It is so nice to be surrounded by all of Lulu's dearest friends!

[Scene cuts to the living room showing the attendees of the party. They include an unknown woman, Gwendolyn, Morton, Lilith, Steve, Eda, King, and Tiny Nose.]

Steve: Yeah! All hail Lulu!

Hooty: We're here to celebrate the new assistant curator of the Supernatural Museum of History. [lifts up his wine cup] Here's to you, Lulu!

All to Lilith: Cheers!

[Lilith accepts everyone's toast with an awkward smile on her face.]

[Luz comes down to the living room wearing a party hat and notices everyone around chatting. She approaches Hooty.]

Luz: Hooty! Did I miss the toast?

Hooty: Yes, but not the "app-pellet-tizers".

[Hooty shows Luz a plate with some owl pellets on it. One of them is still moving and screaming.]

Hooty: You want a- There's an extra one. I'm working on it.

[Hooty attempts to cough out another owl pellet.]

Luz: No, no, no! That's okay. Uh, where's Lilith? We want to congratulate her.

[Luz lift up her hat to show her Echo Mouse hidden in it. Suddenly, a whip appears, grabs one of Hooty's "app-pellet-tizers" and brings it outside. The unknown woman catches the falling "app-pellet-tizer" with her hand.]

Woman: Oh, I wish I could stay longer, but I must be off on my next adventure. [throws away the "app-pellet-tizer]

[Luz peeks outside the door and sees Lilith approaching the unknown woman.]

Woman: It's such a delight to see my little bookworm back in the historical world after all these years.

Lilith: Uh, thank you, Flora, but it's just a small job. Only an assistant. I'm surprised you even heard about this.

Flora: The Emperor wanted to make sure you weren't getting into any trouble. And to clear out your office. I left a box of your knick-knacks inside. Wish you took more from my tutelage, dear. History's supposed to be exciting after all!

[Flora uses her whip to catch a flying Griffin and drags it down to the ground. She then jumps onto the Griffin's back and whips it, flying away with it.]

Luz: Who was that?

Lilith: Flora D'esplora. Bad-girl historian, celebrity, and my formal mentor in the Emperor's Coven.

Luz: I have questions about that name.

Lilith: And I have questions about MY LIFE!!! All I ever got to do was desk work, while she goofed off riding wild snake horses and-

Luz: [eyes light up] Snorses!

Lilith: -And, and eating mummy jerky! Well, I can be just as exciting as Flora. I'll come up with an exhibit that'll knock the Titan's socks off!

[Lilith storms into the house. Luz shouts after her.]

Luz: Congratulations on your new job!

[OPENING THEME, but it is cut short and only shows the show's title.]

[Scene starts with Echo Mouse's playback on Philip's diary entry.]

Philip: After careful analysis during this Deadwardian Era, I believe the current human year is 1660. Or is it '70? The years are flashing by, but it will all be worth it. I've gathered all the portal ingredients including Titan's Blood. All that's left is to seek out The Collector, and he will tell me what I need to complete my mission. But first, my companions and I must face-

[The playback is cut off before Philip can finish. Back at the living room, Luz lies on the couch staring at the ceiling, where the playback was just shown. The Echo Mouse goes to sleep.]

King: The Collector. I've never heard that name.

Eda: Me neither. What kind of jerk puts "The" in front of their name anyway？[picks up trash and put them into trash bag]

Luz: But The Collector may know how to make a real portal door. He may know why mine is so unstable. I just... I messed up so bad last time. I need to do better.

Eda: Luz, I've got leg hair older than you. This Philip guy worked on his door for years. Try not to beat yourself up too much.

Luz: Yeah. [dejectedly] I just with I could go back in time and talk to him.

[A sudden realization hit Luz.]

Luz: Eda! Is time magic a thing?

Eda: Not really, but...

[Eda takes off a book from the shelf titled "History's Top 10 Plot Holes".]

Eda: Back in the day, [opens the book] I was a bit of an urban-legend junkie. Twig Foot, Lenderman, possums...

Luz: Those are real.

Eda: [snorts] Yeah sure, kid. Anyway, there are stories about these things called Time Pools. Mythical puddles that act as windows into the past, but they're never in the same spot twice. Me and Lily used to search for them. She'd say I forced her into it, but I think she had more fun than me.

Luz: Lilith! Of course! Thanks Eda!

[Luz snatches the book off Eda's hands and runs off to find Lilith.]

[At the kitchen, Lilith is busy making model balusters.]

Luz: Lilith!

[Luz suddenly emerges from behind Lilith and calls out her name, startling her.]

Luz: I see you're dealing with all this.

Lilith: I'm plotting out my first exhibit for the museum. It's almost as if the Emperor wanted Flora to tick me off. Well, I'll show her that she's not the only bad-girl historian in town. I'm thinking...

[Lilith takes out a board with information of Deadwardian balusters on it.]

Lilith: "The Architecture History behind Deadwardian Balusters".

[Luz looks at the board and smiles awkwardly. A sudden realization hits Lilith.]

Lilith: [dejectedly] This won't work, will it？

Luz: Don't let Flora get you down! I even started calling you "Cool Aunt Lilith" in my journal.

Lilith: [flattered] Uh, oh, really?

Luz: You can be a bad-girl historian. And I know how.

[Luz shows Lilith the Time Pool section in Eda's book.]

Lilith: Oh, I remember these! "In the Premysteric Era, it's theorized that coagulated Titan Blood mixed with the magical algae of the Boiling Sea created temporary holes in time."

Luz: Time magic, baby! You can make an exciting exhibit on Time Pools, and maybe I can get information on how Philip made the portal door!

Lilith: I... did cobble together a device to find these with Eda. It should be in the box Flora returned to me. But it was faulty. It needed more power than I could ever give it.

[Luz suddenly realizes something.]

Luz: Stay right there!

[Luz runs off to do something. Lilith and her palisman look at each other and shrug. Something crashed to the ground, making a loud noise. Luz runs back to the kitchen holding Amity's glove.]

Luz: Would Titan Blood do the trick?

[Lilith looks at her board.]

Lilith: [determined] Let's do it!

[With the device now working, Luz and Lilith set off to find the Time Pools. At sunset, Luz climbs up a tree and holds up the device, sending energy to its reading instrument. At night, Lilith's palisman flies back with a piece of leaf with an unknown substance on it. Eventually, on the second day, Lilith manages to narrow down the location.]

Lilith: Don't worry, Luz, we're getting closer. I can feel it.

[Lilith swings her knife into a tree beside her. She takes a piece of tree bark and drops it into her device's test tube to test it.]

Lilith: Ha! Exactly what I thought. These are wrinkling oaks.

Luz: [squints] They don't look very wrinkly.

Lilith: That's because something's keeping them locked in time. So, accounting for local plaque patterns, the quake in the '30s, and the switch from boiling units to the empirical system, the time pool should be... [pushes aside two leaves] here!

[Lilith finds the location to be a beach and becomes disappointed.]

Lilith: But... I triple-checked all my calculations. My equipment is first-rate!

[Lilith suddenly trips on something and almost falls down.]

Lilith: Stupid rock! [kicks sand]

[Luz wanders around and kicks a stone, which promptly disappears into an invisible pool, grabbing her attention. She kneels down to check.]

Lilith: Maybe the Titan Blood was too dry? Is it not algae-blooming season?

[Luz pokes her head into the pool, and finds herself staring at the same spot with a completely different surrounding from Prehistoric Era. A beast walks in front of Luz, stops, and screeches.]

Lilith: [at the present] Was it my tools？ Are they broken? [takes off glasses and sniffs] Am... [stares at her reflection on the lenses] I... broken?

[Luz takes her head out from the pool and coughs. She turns her head back to Lilith.]

Luz: Lilith! You did it. [holds up an ammonite] You found the time pools!

[Lilith gasps, turns back towards her reflection and points at it.]

Lilith: In your face!

[Scene cuts back to the same era Luz just saw. The beast from before walks towards the beach. It then stops, scratches itself, yawns, and lie down, turning itself into stone. After witnessing this, Lilith holds her breath and pulls herself back into the present.]

Lilith: A Stonesleeper from the Hecktaceous Period. [turns to Luz] Did you know that they have a ticklish spot behind their ears?

[Luz has her back facing Lilith. She kneels down and pokes at the sand.]

Lilith: Luz, are you listening?

Luz: Come on, time pools. Mama needs to commune with the dead.

[Luz takes a deep breath and pokes her head into the sand. She finds herself in another unfamiliar era. She hears someone talking and looks towards the source of sound. 3 person wearing Medieval-style armor are sitting around a campfire.]

Person 1: Tonight I shall revel so hard, I shan't stand any longer!

Person 2: I shall revel mineself to death!

[Luz pulls her head out back to the present and looks towards the place where the trio were sitting. The skeleton of Person 2 lies there, giving two thumbs ups.]

Lilith: No wonder no one's found these before. They're completely hidden from sight.

[Lilith pokes her head into another Time Pool, which happens to lead to the moment from not so long ago, when her and Luz just arrived at the beach. Her past self accidentally trips on her current self's head and almost falls down.]

Past Lilith: Stupid rock! [kicks sand]

[Lilith pulls her head back to the present and rubs her forehead, which was kicked by her past self. Behind her, Luz pokes her head into another Time Pool. She turns around and finds herself staring at Bonesborough from an unknown era.]

Luz: Wow. It's a little Babysborough!

[Luz notices someone walking nearby and calls out to her.]

Luz: Yo! What era is it？

Woman: 'Tis the Deadwardian Era. What ye be doing in the sand？ Be ye a crab maiden?

Luz: Philip's time!

[Luz pulls her head back. Suddenly, she pokes back out again.]

Luz: And, yes! I am a crab maiden.

[Luz pulls her head back to the present and calls out to Lilith.]

Luz: Lilith!

Lilith: Luz! Look.

[Lilith pulls her head out of a Time Pool with some barnacles on top of it.]

Lilith: There are the oldest barnacles I've ever had on my head.

Luz: I found it! I found Philip's time!

Lilith: [walks towards Luz] Ooh, incredible! This will be a truly unprecedented exploration. N-Now, before we dive in, we must remember if the tide comes in we could be trapped, paradoxes will be a danger, and don't get me started on the bloody fly effect, uh... [clears throat] But a bad-girl historian like myself is all about taking risks. So... let's boogie down to History Town.

[Lilith dances, sings and does finger guns.]

Luz: [mumbles awkwardly] She really is Cool Aunt Lilith.

[Back at the Owl House, someone knocks on the door. Eda goes up to open it and finds Gwendolyn standing outside.]

Gwendolyn: Hello, witchlet.

Eda: Hey, Ma. Why are you still in town? Forget something from yesterday?

Gwendolyn: Your father wanted to swing by.

Eda: [taken aback] Well, tell him I'm busy.

Gwendolyn: Maybe you could tell him yourself? Uh, he's just outside.

King: [gasps] I get to meet my grandpa?

Gwendolyn: Yes. You know, the Clawthorne clan was once known for their Palismen-making skills. And Dell? Whoo, he was the best of them all.

King: Cool!

[Eda notices Dell's shadow approaching outside and becomes panicked.]

[Back at the Deadwardian era, Luz and Lilith comes out from the Time Pool. Lilith steals a straw hat from a pile of laundry nearby while Luz takes off the helmet from Medieval Era Person 2's skeleton. They then arrive at the outskirts of Bonesborough and prepares to go in.]

Lilith: Now, Luz. We are technically in the Savage Ages, way before Belos banished wild magic. These denizens may be dangerous!

[The duo heads into town and bumps into a demon. Expecting an attack, Luz gets into a defensive posture.]

Demon: [tips hat] Good tidings, kind witches.

[Lilith and Luz are surprised by that. Inside Bonesborough, the surrounding appears to be much more peaceful and harmonious than they imagined. Residents can be seen playing musical instruments, helping each other out, and summoning Abominations at will. The duo looks at everything with amazement.]

Luz: This doesn't look dangerous. This looks awesome! Why did Belos want to banish wild magic again?

Lilith: Well, the Titan supposedly doesn't like it. [notices something] Oh, my gosh! look at this thatch work. Each segment looped by hand! [chortles (?) and writes something down]

[Luz walks away. Lilith suddenly stops writing.]

Lilith: But I bet Flora would scoff at it. [becomes upset and closes the notebook]

[Luz approaches a demon sitting on a bench feeding birds. She shows him a drawing of Philip Wittebane's silhouette.]

Luz: Excuse me. Have you seen a human around? Round ears, super smart. Honestly, he's probably a celebrity around here.

Demon: [shrugs] Uh-uh.

[Scene cuts to Luz in front of a stand showing the vendor Philip's drawing.]

Man: [shrugs] Uh-uh.

[Luz shows the drawing to a passer-by.]

Woman: [shakes head] Mm-mmm.

[Luz shows the drawing to another passer-by.]

3-headed demon: Mmm... Nope.

[Luz's face turns glum. Suddenly, both her and Lilith hear someone shouting nearby.]

Unknown: Dance, human. Dance!

[They peek out from behind a wall and see 2 demons gangling up on Philip Wittebane.]

Philip: Give that back!

[The demons throw Philip's diary at each other back and forth.]

Philip: [shakes head, exasperated] I can't believe this. After the bonds of fellowship we forged-

Red Fang: Bonds? Ha! You still owe us.

[Red Fang gives Philip and hard push, causing him to fall to the ground.]

Philip: When I accomplish my mission, I promise you, you'll have your snails.

Green Fang: Listen to this. "With my new and bravest companion, Blue Fang, I set forth. His strength should make fast work of any task." [passes the book to Red Fang]

Red Fang: His pretty little words should make pretty good kindling.

[Red Fang ignites a fire with a spell circle and attempts to burn the book. Philip gasps. An ice spike suddenly pops up and knocks the diary off Red Fang's hand, surprising the demons. Luz steps forward, grabbing their attention.]

Luz: [points] That doesn't belong to you.

[Back at the Owl House at present day. Gwendolyn is outside Eda's room knocking on her door.]

Gwendolyn: Witchlet? Aren't you going to say hello to your father? It's been-

[Inside the room, Eda is busy packing elixirs into Luz's bag.]

Eda: Years! Yep, been years, I know. I'm, uh, just sharpening my tooth. Don't want Pops to see me looking all blech, you feel?

King: [puzzled] What's with you? Why are you so terrified of seeing your dad?

Eda: It's not like I'm scared of him. I just haven't seen him since I ruined his- I mean since the Owl Beast ruined his- [sighs in exasperation] I'm just not ready, okay? Now move it. I gotta scram.

[Eda attempts to flee via the balcony, but Hawksley lands and blocks her path. Eda cries out in surprise and shuts the curtains. She then attempts to escape via the round stained glass window, but finds Hooty waiting outside.]

Hooty: Hiya, Eda! Your pops is such a nice guy. Say, how did he get that scar on his-

[Eda slams the window shut before Hooty can finish his sentence.]

King: [laughs] Hey, Eda, look! [holds up Lilith's old dress and a mop] "Dear sister, join the Emperor's Coven and together, we can become gods!"

[An idea pops up inside Eda's mind. She smirks.]

Eda: Hmm.

[Back at the Deadwardian Era in Bonesborough. Luz stands still confronting the 2 demons who were gangling up on Philip. Red Fang attempts to attack Luz, but is stopped by Green Fang.]

Green Fang: Don't waste your time on the kid. We should keep looking.

Red Fang: [to Luz] Ask your friend there what happened to our brother, Blue Fang, and his Palisman.

[Green Fang kicks on Philip's scattered journals and walks away with Red Fang. Philip starts picking up the journals, but suddenly yelps in pain and holds on to his right leg. He then continues to pick up the journals, and Luz helps him pick up some of it. She looks at one of the pages, which shows a drawing of Eclipse Lake.]

Luz: So he's already gotten to the Titan Blood. [notices drawing of an unknown person] Who's that?

Philip: Hmph! [snatches away the journals from Luz's hands] That's private.

Luz: You're Philip Wittebane, aren't you? The human?

Philip: Here to gawk? I may not have a bile sac, but I do have dignity. [turns away]

Luz: Wait! I've heard of your exploits, and I know what it's like to be far from home. Can we talk?

Philip: [stares at Luz, then squints] No.

[Philip starts to walk away limping.]

Luz: Wait! I can give you snails! I can make you crutches! Um, uh... I can help you find the Collector!

[Philip stops and glances at Luz sideways. Scene cuts to Philip, Luz and Lilith walking through a forest.]

Philip: So, Luzura. You and your Aunt Dirtrude started travelling together after the Toe-gres attacked your castle and covered it with an impenetrable mist?

Luz: Yes. And that's why we, too, seek The Collector. We need him to tell us how to clear the mists so we can return home. Snap, snap, snap.

[Philip brings Luz and Lilith into a cave.]

Philip: Now... anyone bring a torch?

[Luz shows Philip a light glyph and activates it, turning it into a light ball.]

Philip: Astounding! I thought I was the only one who used picto-glyphs.

Luz: You use glyphs too? [passes Philip a light glyph]

Philip: How else could I have survived here? Plant growth, ice, fire... Took years to find them. [sketches the Light glyph pattern into his diary] Almost as if the world wanted to hide them from me. I even found one in a snowflake.

Luz: My dude, me too!

Philip: A warrior and a scholar. Truly impressive.

[Philip walks away.]

Luz: [excitedly] Ah! I can't believe I taught Philip something new! [squeals in excitement]

[Luz walks away to follow Philip. Lilith has a dubious look on her face.]

[Philip leads the duo deeper into the cave, activating Light glyphs along the way.]

Philip: Line there, curve there... fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. [looks back at Lilith] Your niece is very talented. I'm sure she takes after her aunt.

Lilith: [flattered] Oh. [chuckles] Maybe I... had a little something to do with it.

Philip: Now, I know a few tricks as well.

[Philip puts up a light ball and starts to draw a large glyph combo on the ground.]

Luz: What is this?

Philip: A shortcut... [taps on the Glyph combo] to The Collector.

[The glyph combo starts to flash brightly. The screen turns white.]

[Back at the Owl House at present day. Gwendolyn is still standing outside Eda's room.]

Gwendolyn: Really, Eda? [knocks on the door] You won't be able to run away this time.

[Eda suddenly flings the door open. She is wearing Lilith's old dress and a wig atop her head, disguising herself as Lilith.]

Eda: Apologies, dearest mother. Dearest sister has flown the dearest coop. But worry not, for I, the perfect, prissy little Lily, shall find her for you.

[Eda marches away. While walking, her hair starts to come out from beneath the wig.]

Gwendolyn: [incredulously] Does she seriously think I'm buying that?

King: Just let her have this.

[At the backside of the Owl House, Eda flings the door open and escapes outside. She tears off Lilith's dress and takes off her wig.]

Eda: [laughs] Not today, suckers!

[Eda attempts to fly away on her Owl Staff, but immediately stops and gasps when she notices something. Not far away, Dell is standing at the edge of cliff looking at sunset, with his back facing Eda. A yellow cardinal palisman perches on his shoulder.]

Dell: [glances to his right] Am I too late again? [glances ahead] Well, fly safe, witchlet. Perhaps I'll catch you next time.

[Dell's palismen glances towards Eda. After hesitating for a bit, Eda retracts Owlbert's wings.]

Eda: Hi, dad.

[Back at the Deadwardian Era. The bright light fades away. Luz and Lilith open their eyes and find themselves inside an ice cave. There is a tall double door at the end.]

Luz: [gasps] Whoa. Where are we?

[Philip doesn't reply and walks towards the door. Luz looks outside through a wide gap and gasps.]

Luz: We're in the head of the Titan?!

Lilith: W-We're what??? But this is sacred ground!

Philip: I suppose that's why no one wanted to accompany me. [limps towards the door] But every legend told me that The Collector lies there. Behind that door. I just can't figure out the mechanisms to open it. If I weren't so frail...

[Philip winces in pain and kneels down, clutching his right leg.]

Luz: It's okay, we can help! Puzzles are in my blood, literally. My mom had to stop me from eating puzzles when I was a kid. You stay here and rest up.

Philip: Thank you for your kindness, crab maiden. [puts a hand on Luz's shoulder] Perhaps we were destined to meet.

[Luz smiles at Philip. She then runs to Lilith, who is in front of the door trying to open it.]

Lilith: This mechanism is unlike any I've seen before. It'll make a remarkable addition to my exhibit. It's just...

[Lilith hesitates and appears to be contemplating something.]

Luz: Come on, we can't stop now! We're getting everything we could have hoped for!

Lilith: That's just it. Look. Most of this puzzle has been solved already. [glances towards Philip] And Philip...

[Luz glances towards Philip too. He is sitting on the ground writing something.]

Lilith: The confidence, the compliments. He says everything you want to hear. It feels... uncomfortably familiar.

Luz: Some of this is pretty weird. But it's the Boiling Isles! Everything's a little weird, right? Hey, why don't you keep working on this, and I'll go talk to Philip?

[Luz walks towards Philip as Lilith continues trying to solve the puzzle. There is a blue fang and a palisman inside Philip's bag. Luz approaches Philip from behind and reads what he is writing in his diary.]

Luz: "I single-handedly defeated the beast behind the door. Tragically, I could not save my companions."

[Philip notices Luz behind him and stands up.]

Luz: [hesitantly] Philip, why did you bring us here?

[The ground shakes, accompanied by a loud sound. Luz looks back towards the door.]

Lilith: [waves] Ah! I did it! I solved the puzzle!

[Behind her, the doors open inwards.]

Philip: I needed a sacrifice.

Lilith: What'd he say?

[A claw suddenly emerges from inside and grabs Lilith. She screams while being dragged into darkness.]

Luz: Lilith!

Philip: Well, with the beast distracted, I can finally get through those doors.

Luz: [angrily] You tricked us!

Philip: It was-

Luz: Destiny? Balderdash.

Philip: [laughs] I was going to say, "inevitable". You two were easier to trick than Blue Fang. Hopefully you and Aunt Dirtrude can last longer.

[From inside the room comes Lilith's terrified screams. Luz rushes inside and finds a beast grasping Lilith in its claws. It notices Luz and screeches at her.]

Luz: Lilith!

[The beast rushes towards Luz. She immediately activates an Ice glyph and creates an ice trail. The beast slips on the ice and falls down, loosening its grip. Lilith jumps off. Luz grabs her hand and they run away together. Meanwhile, Philip walks up to a platform and starts digging. The beast stands up and chases after Lilith and Luz.]

Lilith: [angrily at Philip] Hey! That better be your own grave you're digging!

[Luz activates Fire glyphs to create flames, temporarily blinding the beast. Meanwhile, Philip's shovel hit something. He grins and picks up the object.]

Philip: Found you.

[He looks at his reflection in the object, which is a mirror with a crescent moon drawing on it. Meanwhile, Luz and Lilith try to hide from the beast behind a pillar.]

Luz: I know you want to get home, but nothing is worth hurting people!

[The beast swings its tail at the duo and breaks the pillar, barely missing them. It continues chasing after the duo.]

Philip: Oh, I disagree. It was nice making a cat's-paw out of you. [draws the glyph combo on ground] Good luck with your... crab castle... or... whatever. You witches come up with the worst lies.

[Philip taps on the glyph combo. It flashes and teleports him away. The beast is distracted by the flash and rushes towards it. Luz grabs Lilith by the hand and runs towards a pillar, hiding behind it.]

Lilith: Is this how it all ends for Lilith Clawthorne? Her body lost to time?

Luz: You were right about that jerkweed. I'm so sorry, Lilith.

Lilith: Oh, your humility before death truly heartens me.

Luz: Yeah, I should have listened to you.

[Luz suddenly realizes something.]

Luz: [gasps] Wait... I did listen to you!

Lilith: Uh...

[Luz runs off.]

Lilith: LUZ!!!

[Luz runs towards the beast. The beast notices Luz and turns its head towards her. Luz continues to run towards it.]

Lilith: [nervously] Eda's gonna kill me, Eda's gonna kill me, Eda's gonna kill me!!!

[Lilith covers her eyes. Suddenly, she hears a thud. She takes a peek and sees Luz scratching the beast behind its ear.]

Luz: It's one of those Stonesleepers from the Hecktaceous period! It must have been hibernating in here for ages. [continues scratching] Aw. Do you like that, boy? Aw, you're a good boy.

Lilith: [sheds a tear, gladly] You were listening.

[Scene cuts to Philip walking on a trail inside a forest. He is writing something down on his diary.]

Philip: "And so I doggedly limped home, but I had my prize." [puts his diary into his bag and takes out the mirror] How to describe you? Oval? Oblong? A round boy?

[Philip hears some loud thuds behind him. He turns around and sees the Stonesleeper from inside the cave. It screeches at him, causing him to gasp in shock. Luz and Lilith jump down from the Stonesleeper's back.]

Luz: Tell me how that thing's gonna help you build a portal to the Human Realm.

[Philip looks down at his mirror.]

Philip: Oh, no. [puts the mirror into his bag] I need this for something else.

Luz: No? [furiously] WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NO"?!

Philip: I mean, if it's information you want, perhaps we can make an exchange. I'll probably require another sacrifice sooner or later. [walks towards the duo] If you or your aunt want to-

[Lilith walks towards Philip and punches him square in the face, breaking his nose.]

Philip: Ugh! Ah! [angrily] You hateable sorcerers!

Lilith: [angrily] Stay mad. [to Luz] Come, Luzura. We're finished here.

[Luz sneers while making hand gestures at Philip.]

Luz: Cool aunt.

[Luz climbs up to the Stonesleeper's back with Lilith. They ride off together, and the Stonesleeper accidentally kicks Philip in the head while walking off. Lilith notices that Luz is upset.]

Lilith: You know, Luz, if some jerk like Philip can build a portal, then I'm sure you can too.

Luz: [gladly] Thanks. Hey, we have a little time before the tide comes in. You want to do something exciting?

[Lilith looks at Luz with a puzzled expression. Scene cuts to the duo inside Bonesborough. Lilith is watching a craftsman making balusters.]

Lilith: [excitedly] Balusters, Luz! Deadwardian balusters!

[Lilith jots down the process inside her notebook. Behind her, Luz watches on gladly.]

[Back at present day. Eda is sitting with her dad at the cliff.]

Eda: Sorry, I, uh, haven't been in touch. There's been a lot going on.

Dell: [sighs] You disappear from Bonesborough, you're fixing up my old tower, and then suddenly I see you on a wanted poster. And your mother tells me about the petrification. I wish you'd let us help. But I do hear I have a grandson now.

Eda: [chuckles] Yep, King's a Clawthorne. He can be a handful, but-

Dell: It's been over 20 years, witchlet. I can't chase you anymore.

Eda: [emotionally] Then stop! I've ruined your life. Have you even been able to carve a new Palisman since I attacked you?

[Dell lifts up his left hand, which trembles. Eda looks at it with a guilty expression, then looks away. Dell puts down his hand.]

Eda: Stop trying to forgive me. [stands up and walks away] I don't deserve it.

[Eda walks towards the Owl House looking guilty. Suddenly, Dell taps his hand on her shoulder, stopping her. Eda turns to look at him.]

Dell: Don't worry, I'm not here to try that again.

[Dell opens up his left palm, showing Eda something on it.]

Eda: What... is that?

Dell: It's a palistrom seed. My Palisman-making days are over, but I've been helping the Bat Queen replenish her forests, so someone new can learn the trade.

Eda: [jokingly] Did you come all the way here just to brag?

Dell: Yes! But also to say, [offers Eda the seed] let the past stay in the past, witchlet. It's okay to move on. [puts his hand on Eda's hand] And give Owlbert my regards. [walks away] Carving him with you is one of my dearest memories.

[Eda watches as Dell walks into the Owl House. Touched by his words, Eda smiles with tears in her eyes. Right then, behind her, Luz and Lilith arrive back while riding on Lilith's Raven Staff.]

Lilith: We got lucky today, Luz. Next time those Time Pools show up, they could be on the other side of the world.

Eda: [turns and walks towards the duo] Hey nerds! How was your nerd quest? You find that dead nerd?

Luz: Layin' it on a little thick there, Eda. But, yeah, we found Philip.

Eda: Whoa, seriously?

Luz: [grumpily] Yeah. He stunk.

Lilith: I punched him in the face.

Luz: Groovy, auntie.

[Luz and Lilith grin while making finger guns at each other, much to Eda's annoyance.]

Eda: Uh, you gu- you guys need to stop that.

[Back in Deadwardian Era. Philip arrives at the cave where he lives in while grunting in pain. He trips on a stone and kicks in away forcefully with his right leg.]

Philip: Those barbarians. Those, those... WITCHES!!!

[Philip's voice echoes throughout the cave. He puts up some light balls. Suddenly, he grimaces in pain and rolls up his sleeve, revealing his swollen right arm with multiple glyphs on it. He staggers forward, kneels down, and grabs a Palisman from the ground. He breaks it in half, absorbing the essence into his eyes and nose. He then exhales deeply. When he speaks again, his voice overlaps with another voice, which sounds similar to Emperor Belos.]

Philip/Belos: It doesn't matter. [takes out the mirror and holds it up] I just need to live long enough to see this through.

[Philip wipes his hand on the mirror. It flashes and starts projecting an animation onto the wall.]

Philip/Belos: [grins sinisterly] And you're going to help me, Collector.
