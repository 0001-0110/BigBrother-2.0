[Open on Eda's human collectibles stand in the market. King is jumping on the table, trying to grab a flag hanging above him.]
King: Weh! [falls off the table] Stupid flag!
[Luz walks in carrying a ladder and a wooden sign.]
Luz: It's been a little slow around here, but I've got just the thing to attract customers.
[She puts the wooden sign on top of the "HUMAN COLLECTABLES" sign and taps it, activating the light glyphs carved into it.]
Luz: And who doesn't like their name in lights?
[Fully illuminated, a winking face of Eda appears.]
Luz: Is it too subtle?
Boscha: Does subtle mean ugly?
[Boscha, Skara, and an Oracle track student are standing at the stand.]
Luz: Hi, Boscha! Hexsidians! See anything you like?
Boscha: Ew! No. I'm just here to take an ironic Penstagram next to your weird flashing trash sign.
[She summons her scroll and takes several pictures.]
Luz: It's not funny, Boscha.
Boscha: What are you going to do? Spit your human venom on me?
King: You have venom? Quick, Luz, start melting faces!
Luz: [kneels down] Even if I could, it's not worth it. You wouldn't understand how to handle teens like her.
King: [grabs her hood] No, I'll show you what to do. [grunts, jumps onto the table] You will tremble before me!
[The three teens stare at him.]
Boscha: Oh, he's so cute!
[She hugs King and summons her scroll, taking a picture with a filter.]
King: Weh! [shoves her face]
Boscha: How much? I have to own him.
King: [frees himself] You couldn't afford me, sister!
All: Aw!
King: That's the incorrect reaction!
Eda: [sniffs] I smell an easy mark. [jumps out of the tent] Hey, kid! Can I offer you the latest fashions from... [magically dresses herself in horribly clashing clothes] the human realm?
Boscha: Yeah, no.
[Skara and the Oracle track student laugh as the three of them leave.]
Eda: Well, [returns to her normal outfit] I hate her.
Luz: Yeah, teens can be sour, but I'm a little sweetie. Look what I made you!
[She points to her sign.]
Eda: Luz! [takes the sign down]
Luz: Did I spell something wrong? Or did I spell something right?
Eda: Stop that. [wipes away the lights] You may be forgetting something, Luz. I'm kinda... [holds up her wanted poster] on the run! Remember? Every guard in town would be at my doorstep if I had my name in lights.
Luz: Well, I don't see anyone right now. Maybe you're just being paranoid. You're a powerful witch. Why hide when you can "poof" all your problems away with magic?
King: What does Luz know about problems anyway? All she has is dumb teen drama! She doesn't understand how hard some of us have it.
Eda: You're pampered all day like a dang baby. How hard is that life?
King: Well, I don't know if you realized, but I'm not a baby!
Luz: Then why are you screaming like one?
King: My life is a living nightmare!
Eda: Well, there's only one thing to do when friends can't see eye to eye.
Luz: Hug each other till we pass out? [hugs King]
King: Fight to the death!
Eda: Pfft, no. Body swap!
King: [to Luz] Are you sure you don't shoot venom?
-THEME SONG-
Eda: I love a good body swap. It's like demonic possession with the ones you love.
Luz: We're doing that? That's possible? [grabs a VHS box] This is just like my favorite early 2000s movie! Freaky Fraturday. But maybe we should think about this for a second.
Eda: Body swap!
Luz: Ooh!
[Eda spins her staff above their heads, a curtain of yellow light and smoke falling over them.]
Luz: [in Eda's body] Did it work? I need a mirror. [runs into the mirror with a grunt, slides down] Found one. Oh, my gosh. It worked! I'm so old... [grabs her ears] and pointy!
[King in Luz's body walks up to the mirror.]
Luz: Hot dog! It's me!
King: [in Luz's body] Yeah, it is. I'm the human now. Bow before my massive, meaty hands!
Luz: Wait, so that means...
[Eda clears her throat. Luz and King look back at the table, where the last of the smoke dissipates.]
Eda: [posing in King's body] How do I look?
King: I've got some... very confusing emotions right now.
Eda: All right, here's the deal. Whoever can prove their new body has the easiest life gets out of house cleaning duty. And you know what that means.
[Cut to Hooty giggling maniacally as he plays in the mud. Cut back to the three of them shuddering.]
King: Won't be me. Life as a teen is a tyrant's dream! [to Luz] By the end of the day, I'll be ruling over your feeble demographic.
Luz: Well, I've got magic. Eda, don't be too mad when your inventory's gone and the guards are none the wiser.
[She accidentally casts a beam of light that knocks her on the ground.]
Eda: Ha! That's cute. [hops off the table and walks off] If you need me, I'll be getting pampered on a vacation fit for a king.
King: My life's not a joke! [to Luz] But yours is. [pokes Luz's nose] Bap. [laughs and runs away]
[Cut to Eda walking through town. She grabs a pair of sunglasses, puts them on and poses. Freeze frame with the words "Eda's Catastrophe" above her. She continues walking.]
Woman: Look at that little baby!
Eda: Oh, hello.
Man: So adorable!
Eda: Yes, hello to you too, handsome.
Guard: Stop right there!
[A guard with a four-headed dog is staring at her.]
Eda: An emperor's guard.
Dog: [sniffs, growls]
Guard: Thought you could get away with it, didn't you?
Eda: Wait, you know who I am?
Guard: Of course, I do. You're... the cutest little angel I've ever seen! Who wants a lolly? [holds out a lollipop]
Eda: [tosses the sunglasses and takes the lollipop] Ha! That's more like it.
Dog: [sniffs, whines]
Eda: [taunts] You got nothing! [laughs and walks away]
[The dog licks its nose where Eda hit it with the lollipop.]
Eda: [sighs] Being King is a walk in the park. I'm gonna win this bet for sure. [stops walking] Wha‐‐
Roselle: Oh, Dottie! Look at this lost little dumpling!
Eda: What's that? [is picked up] Whoa! Hey, I'm not lost, you creeps!
Roselle: Poor baby! Do you need us to make you a delicious meal?
Eda: No, I don't need you‐‐
[Roselle scratches Eda's belly.]
Eda: Tummy scratches? Ooh. You know what? Maybe I am lost. Take me away, ladies.
[They walk down an alley, their shadows looming on the wall. Cut to a kitty café, where two creatures meow in the window and a demon with several giant eyes is painting words on the window. Roselle and Dottie carry Eda inside.]
Roselle: Welcome to our kitty café. This is our little safe haven for cherubs like you.
[Various witches and demons are playing with smaller creatures, only one of which actually looks like a cat.]
Eda: Ugh... What hot mess is going down here?
Roselle: You see, precious cargo like you should be taken care of. Boop! All you should have to worry about is how many belly rubs you want or how much tasty num‐nums you're gonna eat. [puts Eda into a crib]
Eda: Well, my creep alarm is ringing, but I can't argue with num‐nums. [takes the cupcake Dottie hands her]
Roselle: This place is a safe place. A place clean from the outside world. And those teenagers who filthen it. [points to a sign behind her reading "NO TEENS A-MEOW-ED"] You have a good nap, my dearest. And welcome... to your new home.
[Her and Dottie walk through the employees only door. Eda tosses the cupcake aside.]
Eda: Ha! Oh, being adorable is the life. [yawns] Time for a nap.
[She pulls out a pillow, pats it, and lays down. A shadow passes over as something meows. Eda opens her eyes with a gasp. She peeks over the edge of the crib, and Bowtie jumps up.]
Bowtie: Leave this place!
Eda: [gasps]
Bowtie: [jumps into the crib and grabs Eda by the collar] Danger is near.
Roselle: [through the door] Baby demon! We have a surprise for you!
Eda: You hear that, Bowtie? [shoves him out of the crib]
Bowtie: [grunts] Ow!
Eda: There's a new star in town.
[The door opens.]
Bowtie: [yowls and runs]
Roselle: A gift for our new, cutest demon. [holds out a bee costume]
Eda: Okay, I'm out. [crawls out of the crib and goes to the door] Novelty costumes are where I draw the line.
Roselle: Dottie, please help our little angel get changed.
[Dottie shrieks and growls, hopping on various pieces of furniture in order to stop Eda.]
Roselle: Oh, no, sweetie. You can't survive out there without us.
Eda: Ladies, stand back. I am not above disrespecting my elders. [twirls her finger; sighs] Oh, dang. I'm not a witch right now.
Roselle: No, baby. You're a cutie patootie. [reaches for Eda]
Eda: [runs] Not today, sister!
Roselle: No!
Dottie: [shrieks]
[Eda runs through the employees only door. She closes it behind her and moves a chair below the handle.]
Roselle: Let us in this instant! It is not time for you to be there.
Eda: Stop babying me!
[She turns around, then visibly gets uncomfortable. Inside the room are various demons in rocking chairs, stacked in shelves, all of them grinning ominously and most of them drooling.]
Eda: This vacation just took an alarming, back‐alley turn. [waves her hand in front of one of them]
Baby: Tasty num‐nums.
Eda: Ew.
Bowtie: Don't bother.
Eda: [shouts]
Bowtie: Their minds are tragically gone. They've been coddled so long, they forgot how to live on their own. Their brains turned to mush.
Eda: Geez, I thought I liked being babied. But I feel so small and helpless, like some sort of... baby. But that won't happen to us, right?
Bowtie: [purrs while playing with a ball of yarn; gurgles]
Eda: I failed you, Bowtie. My closest ally.
Bowtie: Meow. Meow. [rolls face first onto the floor]
[Pounding.]
Eda: [gasps]
Dottie: [growling]
Eda: I'll avenge you, Bowtie! [throws him]
Bowtie: [meows]
[Bowtie lands on Roselle's face. Dottie goes to help her. Eda sees sunlight.]
Eda: Ooh!
[She runs for the light, diving through a hole. She runs into a window.]
Eda: Huh?
Monster: [grunts and floats away]
Dottie: [snarling]
Roselle: Oh, wonderful! Now everyone can see our bestest baby... [holds up the bee costume] forever.
Eda: No!
[Cut to King successfully jumping and grabbing a flag.]
King: Weh! Not so high and mighty anymore. [throws it on the ground] I feel so alive! [yelps]
[He falls into a trashcan. Freeze frame with "KING'S BRUSH WITH DEATH" above the trash can. Action resumes as the trash can falls. A water balloon hits the ground next to the trash can. Tentacles grow out of the water.]
King: [backing away] Oh, no! [shouts and ducks] The flag, it seeks revenge.
[Distant laughing is heard. King looks to a cliff, where Skara and a Potions student are standing. The latter throws a water balloon on the ground.]
Man #1: [caught in tentacles] Help me! I'm a delicate man.
King: Teenagers.
[Cut to King pulling himself onto the cliff. Close by, Skara and a male potions student are shown to be the ones throwing water balloons.]
Potions Student: [grabbing another water balloon from a bag] Hey, take this, society! [breaks the balloon over himself] Oh, no. [shouts]
[A tentacle grabs him, causing Skara to cringe. King crawls over to a building with signs reading "TREASURE SHACK." King sniffs under the curtain, then looks under it. Amelia and Boscha are on their scrolls while the Oracle student is flying upside down with winged boots, attempting to do a sit-up.]
Oracle Student: [groaning]
Boscha: [scoffs] Just give up.
Oracle Student: I swear, I can do a sit‐up. I'm just having a bad day. [groans]
Boscha: Sure, you can.
[Amelia stands and throws a peace sign as Boscha goes over to take a picture of him struggling.]
King: I'll show Luz how to rule over these doofuses. [enters] Greetings! Er... [stands up] Greetings! Bow before your king of humans.
Oracle Student: [falls and grunts] Hey, nobody tells me what to do.
Boscha: [scoffs] Shut it.
Oracle Student: Sorry, Boscha.
Boscha: [typing on her scroll] New post: Loser human thinks she can hang out in our sacred Treasure Shack. Spoiler alert: She can't.
Oracle Student: [flying over] Yeah, get out of here, Goody Two‐Shoes.
King: Goody Two‐Shoes, huh?
[King steals his flying boots, making him fall on the ground. King flies out of the Treasure Shack, grabbing the bag of water balloons from Skara.]
King: Hey, impressionable youths!
[Amelia and the Oracle student walk out, them and Skara staring up at King.]
King: Under my command, you could learn how to do some real damage. Nyeh!
[He swings the bag around and throws the whole thing. Tentacles taller than the library spring forth. King spins around to face them slowly.]
King: All hail, your new teen king.
Oracle Student: I didn't like her telling me what to do before, but now, I love it.
Boscha: [huffs]
King: Who wants to revolt with me today?
Skara: Yay! You're the coolest.
Oracle Student: We love you now.
Amelia: I love it!
[Skara and Amelia fly off with King. The Oracle student looks down at his socked feet.]
Oracle Student: Uh, I'll catch up. [runs after them]
Boscha: Hold up. I did not give you permission to leave.
[Amelia flies down and picks up the Oracle student.]
King: All right, you acne‐encrusted hormone buckets. Let's go let out some teen angst!
Music: ♪ You're hanging with the cool kids ♪ ♪ Breaking all the rules kids ♪ ♪ We're gonna have to fool the kids ♪ ♪ Into thinking that you're cool too ♪ ♪ They pierce their noses ♪ ♪ They dye their hair... ♪
[As the music plays, the teens wreck havoc through town. The Oracle student shuffles the facial features of two witches waiting for the bus, making them both scream. A third lowers a newspaper to show that their face is already shuffled. King shrugs. The Oracle student shuffles their face to normal orientation. They scream. Cut to a sign that reads "SELF STORAGE." Amelia takes off the "S" and the "STO." She and the others hide behind a booth as an elf approaches the sign now reading "ELF RAGE".]
Elf: Yeah, this sign gets it!
[He grunts and rips his shirt off, then punches the sign and runs off. The teens laugh, then gasp and run off when the elf returns. Cut to them all laughing as King, holding a crow, shushes them.]
King: Guys, be quiet.
[He dials a number on the crow, which caws. Cut to the Owl House, where a crow caws repeatedly. Hooty picks it up.]
Hooty: Hoot House. Hooty Hooting.
[Cut back to town, where the teens are still laughing. King tosses the crow into a megaphone.]
Hooty: Oh, wow. I've been waiting for someone to call all day, and now, it's finally happened! We can talk for hours, and hours, and hours, and hours...
Man #2: [screams]
[Cut to the teens walking through town, the Oracle student and Amelia holding bags of onion rings. The backing music stops.]
King: [laughs] I don't know what Luz is talking about. This life is a breeze. [gasps]
Boscha: Enough! I don't know why they can't remember what a weirdo loser you are, but I'm gonna help them remember.
King: Ooh, I'm so scared. [chuckles] She still thinks she has power over you guys.
[The other three are all staring at Boscha in fear.]
King: Guys?
Boscha: Luz, I challenge you to a race... around Dead Man's Curve.
[She points to a winding road held up with bones. Lightning strikes the road, knocking a chunk of it off.]
All: [gasps]
Boscha: And we'll be racing on those. [points] Giant rat worms.
King: Meh.
Skara: You don't have to do this, you know. We know humans are, like, super fragile.
King: Don't baby me! [walks up to Boscha] Boscha, I accept your strange teenaged, coming‐of‐age challenge thing.
[Cut to Dead Man's Curve as one of the bones supporting it crumbles. King shoves one of the rat worms to the starting line where Boscha is already sitting, now wearing wing boots of her own. Amelia pulls out an onion ring.]
Amelia: On your mark...
[King climbs onto his rat worm as Boscha smirks at him.]
Amelia: Get set...
King: [gulps]
[Amelia bites into the onion ring. Boscha's rat worm immediately takes off. King's does not.]
King: Let's go!
[Rat worm growls.]
King: Worm minion, I said go!
[He smacks the worm's tail. It screams and takes off.]
King: Stop! I said stop! [screaming]
[King's rat worm rolls down Dead Man's Curve as King rides it backwards. Boscha takes the turns expertly while King bounces off of them. Despite that, he catches up.]
Boscha: [gasps]
King: This is how the cool kids ride. Super backwards. On purpose.
[Boscha growls. She faces forward and gasps, pulls her rat worm to a stop. King speeds past.]
King: Yes! Say bye‐bye to your popularity, Boscha.
Boscha: [waves mockingly] Bye‐bye.
[King turns around and sees a caution sign with blinking worms. He yelps and tries to stop his rat worm, but it's too late. He plows into the caution sign and plummets, destroying the Treasure Shack.]
King: [falls off the rat worm] Ow.
Skara: Not the Treasure Shack!
Oracle Student: I don't know how to process this. Someone tell me what to do!
Boscha: [smirks] Get her!
[They all take off after King.]
King: Weh!
[King runs. They follow. He slides down a hill and takes off on all fours.]
Boscha: Get back here, human!
King: Luz was right. I can't handle the complexities of teenage life. I just want my body back.
[He runs into the paint can left outside the kitty café.]
Boscha: I think I saw her go this way.
[King runs inside. The teens fly past it. King catches his breath, then sighs in relief. The lights flick on.]
King: Huh?
[Roselle stomps in.]
Roselle: Dottie! A teen has come to steal our little babies. [wields a broom]
King: No, wait! I am a little baby! [runs]
Roselle: No, you're not. You're a rotten teen! But when we finish with you, you'll be calling for your mother. [grabs knitting needles and drags them over her teeth]
King: Lady, I just want my body back.
Eda: You can have it. Your life is pretty terrible. But, hey, it'll probably be over soon.
Dottie: [snarls, tosses a bag over King]
[Cut to the market, where Luz stands up.]
Luz: Whew! Okay, let's try this again. And strut, strut, strut. [grunts]
[She falls against a box and knocks over a lamp. Freeze frame with Luz looking at the words, "LUZ'S DEALS IN HEELS." Action resumes as Luz lifts up her foot.]
Luz: How does Eda wear these all day? [sees the broken lamp] Oh, no. What have my heels done? Wait a second. I'm a ding dang witch!
[She draws a spell circle at the lamp, blasting herself into the air. She lands behind the table with a yelp.]
Luz: Boy, Eda is powerful. [yells as magic comes out of her hand] Not again!
[Cut to Luz putting oven mitts on, her pointer finger sticking out of each.]
Luz: Okay, let's try this one more time.
[She draws a spell circle over the lamp, fixing it and giving it human legs.]
Luz: [coughs, gasps] I made magic with my hands! [jumps]
Man #2: [looking at the lamp] Ooh, so unnecessarily extravagant. I'll take it.
Luz: Zippo swappo. Sold to the savvy shopper.
[She draws a spell circle and the lamp walks off. The man follows it, tossing Luz a snail.]
Luz: Okay, magic hands, let's see what else we can magically magic.
[With a snap of her fingers, a giant neon sign and spotlights appear at the stand. She is now wearing a top hat reading "EDA."]
Luz: Step right up and feast your eyes on the marvels of the human realm!
Customer #1: Oh, what is this?
Customer #2: Where did the other stand go?
Customer #3: Your lights are too bright, and I forgot what I came here for.
Luz: Was it for laughter? [magics a feather duster to tickle him]
Customer #3: [laughing] Joy! So painful. [hands her fistfuls of snails] I'll take two for my enemies.
[A centaur walks up and points to his blank human face. Luz uses a marker to draw him a face. The centaur cries with joy and piles the table high with snails. A baby wails in a carriage. A giant pacifier appears in its mouth. The baby's parent dumps an entire coin purse onto the table. Various customers leave the stand.]
Luz: Thank you! Come again! There's a little something for everyone. Take it from me, Eda, the Boiling Isles' gift to magic.
Guard #1: Is that right? You're the famous Eda the Owl Lady?
Luz: That depends. Are you a fan... [reaches into the top hat and pulls out flowers] of magic?
[The flowers make a sound effect as their eyes shine.]
Guard #1: No, but I am a fan of... [takes cloak off] the law.
Flowers: Oh, no! [wilt and die]
[The guard cuffs Luz.]
Guard #2: [approaches the stand] We were finally able to catch you in the act. All thanks to this little light show of yours.
Luz: [looks between them] Gentlemen, whaddya say we forget this whole thing ever happened? Amnesia spell!
[She summons a pacifier into the second guard's mask. He narrows his eyes.]
Luz: Haven't quite got the hang of this yet.
[Cut to a police precinct. A camera shutters, and Luz is standing in front of a height chart holding a prisoner number card.]
Camera Monster: [coughs] This is some of my best work. Really captures the shame.
[Owlbert is taken by a guard. He chirps in protest as the guard puts a ring around his wings.]
Guard #3: [laughs, slams door] Yeah, you're going away for a long time, you filthy criminal.
Owlbert: [hoots nervously]
Luz: Owlbert! This is all a big mistake. [led into an interrogation room] You're gonna laugh when I explain.
[Cut to a hallway, where Emperor's Coven guards are drinking water. A shadow passes over them.]
Guard #3: [gasps] Is it really her?
Guard #4: Oh, no. This is not good.
Guard #1: Hey, you gotta take that thing out before someone sees you.
Guard #2: I like it. Calms the nerves.
[Lilith's reflection appears in the one-way mirror.]
Guard #2: Hmm? [spits out the pacifier] Uh...
Guard #1: Madame Lilith, to what do we owe this honor?
Lilith: Word reached me that you captured my sister. I'll take it from here.
Guard #1: But Madame, she's going straight to the Conformatorium. I have the order right here.
[He pulls out a piece of paper, which burns in a blue fire.]
Lilith: The orders have changed.
Luz: Look, guys, you got the wrong Eda.
Lilith: Hello, Edalyn.
Luz: Oh, thank goodness! A familiar face. You're Eda's sister, right? Is it Libby? No. Limby...
Lilith: Your show of affection is touching. Do you know why you're here?
Luz: Well, as I was telling the guard, this is just a classic Freaky Fraturday mix‐up.
Lilith: Sister, [unfurls a lengthy scroll] the charges against you are long and many. Operating a stand without a permit, owning a hocus without a pocus...
Luz: Yeah, I think that list goes on for a while.
Lilith: These charges are serious. There's no more running away, Edalyn.
Luz: I know. I can't just "poof" my problems away.
Lilith: [in a lighter tone, holding Luz's shoulders] But we can. You getting caught was clearly a cry for help. Join the Emperor's Coven, like we dreamed about when we were girls.
Luz: Eda wanted to be in the Emperor's Coven?
Lilith: Don't be afraid, sister. Soon, you won't be a danger to those around you. Bring out the branding glove.
[She summons rings of light that secure Luz to the chair.]
Luz: The what now?
[A guard puts on a glove with the logo of the Emperor's Coven on the palm. The logo glows red. He tosses the table aside and cracks his knuckles.]
Luz: Wait, you're making a mistake! [draws a large spell circle] I'm not a danger to anyone! [realizes what she did] Uh‐oh.
[A wall of the precinct explodes.]
Luz: [coughs] Owlbert, come to me!
Owlbert: [hoots, flies through the gate]
Luz: Huh? Ah! [grunts as Owlbert hits her face; stands] Sorry, buddy. [frees Owlbert] Eda's life is more complicated than I thought.
[Luz runs through the hole in the wall. Lilith stands, her hair mussed.]
Lilith: [growls]
Luz: [running] Okay, if I were Eda and Eda is King, where would I be? Ah! This thing's so confusing.
Lilith: After her!
[Luz walks backwards, looking at Lilith and the guards. Knocking at a window makes her face forward. She's at the kitty café.]
Eda: Luz! Bring my dang body over here.
Luz: Eda!
Roselle: Oh, look, Dottie. It's not kidnapping if they entered our store. Just think of it as good customer service.
[Outside, Luz draws a spell circle. The lamp next to the women grows legs and several other lamp heads. Luz enters.]
Roselle: Why did our lamp get unnecessarily extravagant?
[The women turn and see Eda helping King through the hole. Everyone makes eye contact.]
Luz and King: [gasp]
Eda: Hi.
Luz: Go, go, go!
[They all run.]
Roselle: [gasps] After them!
Dottie: [shrieks and holds up a net]
[Luz, King, and Eda arrive on main street.]
Luz: What weird stuff did you get my body into?
Lilith: There she is.
Dog: [barking]
Eda: I got the same question.
[Boscha, Skara, Amelia, and the Oracle student fly in on their boots.]
King: Dang! I forgot about them.
Eda: All right. Did everybody learn a valuable lesson about experiencing each other's hardships?
King and Luz: Yep.
Eda: Good, let's end this nightmare. [takes her staff] Body swap!
[Everyone returns to their own bodies. Eda is still wearing the bee costume, though it immediately rips off. King is still in the volunteer shirt and Luz takes off the oven mitts.]
King: My body! My glorious little body!
Lilith: Sister. Time and again I've offered you my help, yet you foolishly run back to your worthless life. I'm tired of trying, Edalyn. Your days of running are over!
Eda: Thanks, Luz.
Luz: Sorry.
Eda: Don't worry, I got this. Body swap!
[She spins her staff and directs the beam at everyone while Luz and King duck.]
Lilith: [as the dog, barking] Eda, you rotten sister! Switch me back! Ah! [barks]
Guard #1: [in Roselle's body] What's happening? Who the heck are you?
Guard #2: [in Dottie's body] I'm a Coven guard, wise mouth.
Guard #1: No, you're not. I am!
Roselle: [in the Oracle student's body] You get outta my body, you galoot!
Guard #2: Fight! Ow. My knees.
Someone in Boscha's body: Hey! Ow!
Someone in the body of a guard: This is your fault. Let go! My arm! Ow!
Guard #1: [screaming]
[General mayhem ensues.]
King: Are they gonna be okay?
Eda: Eh?
Luz: Eda, I just wanna say that things can be more complicated than you think. But with you guys, it all feels a little less mixed up.
Eda: Aw, that's sweet, kid. Now, let's never speak of this again.
[Owlbert hoots as he unfurls his wings. Everyone who was body swapped clamors as Eda, Luz, and King fly off.]
Dog: [in Lilith's body] [howls]
[Cut to Eda, Luz, and King flying in front of the moon.]
