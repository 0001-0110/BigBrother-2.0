[Open on Luz and King painting in the woods.]
Luz: When I first got here I thought everything was scary or stinky or both. But I've learned to see the beauty in everything by getting outside and painting in nature.
King: [climbs up Luz's shoulder and points at her painting] Who's that?
[Focus on Luz's painting, which is the view in front of her but with a dark, mysterious figure behind a tree.]
Luz: Oh, that's just some bushes that looked like a dark, mysterious figure, right?
[Takes her painting off the easel to reveal exactly what looks like her painting, but without the figure.]
Luz: That's funny. Wasn't there....? [shakes her head] Anyway, I-- [gasp]
[She puts the painting back on the easel. The figure has moved to the foreground, now much larger. She backs away from the painting before peering over it nervously, seeing the still-empty forest.]
Luz: Sometimes my imagination gets away from me. [sweating] Only paint what you see, Luz.
King: [fur stands on end] L-L-Luz?
[The figure in the painting is now holding a sign reading "I'M BEHIND YOU". A shadow falls over them.]
Luz and King: [turn around and scream]
[Cut to black. A light spell is activated, showing a terrified Luz and King under what appears to be a blanket.]
Luz: And you know, sometimes you can find beauty and grow as an artist from the safety of your own bed. [Starts drawing in a notepad.]
[Zooms out to reveal that they're in Luz's room, the window behind them boarded up. Continue zooming out to reveal that the dark figure from before has painted the scene on a canvas.]
Dark Figure: So true.
[The dark figure continues painting.]
