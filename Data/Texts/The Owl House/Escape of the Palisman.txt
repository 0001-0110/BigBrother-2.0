[Open on a playground in the middle of Bonesborough. Several baby-track Hexside students are there. A sign at the front gate reads "THE SLAYGROUND funded by the Bonesborough department of parks & wreck". Cut to a sign above a bench that reads "ALL BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTERS MUST BE LEASHED." Eda and Luz are sitting on a bench under the sign.]

Luz: [visibly nervous] What if he gets hurt? What if the kids are mean to him? [gasps] My parental instincts are freaking out, man.

Eda: He's fine. Look at him.

[Cut to King trying to climb the slide.]

Luz: It does look like he's having fun.

King: [grunting]

Luz: Aw. I wonder what cute little game he's playing.

King: Stand back, cretins. [grunting as he reaches the top] Yes! Yes! This is a throne worthy of a tyrant. Bow to me you snotty underlings. Bow!

Kids: [share a look] Okay.

[One does a handstand while the other does a backbend.]

King: Yes, appease your master.

Usurper: This isn't for standing, it's for sliding. You try. [shoves him]

King: Whoa, whoa! [screams, grunts] Eda! [runs to his friends, clings to Luz's leg] That monster took my throne.

Eda: You mean the baby?

King: No, the usurper. I want you to go over there and blow him up. Kaboom!

Usurper: [riding a spring rider] Kaboom!

Eda: [unscrews Owlbert from staff] Yeah, I'm not using Owlbert to blow up a five‐year‐old.

Owlbert: [hoots]

Eda: He's got better things to do. Like this... [pets him]

Owlbert: [warbling]

Luz: Aw, what a sweetie. How did you get him?

Eda: Get? I made Owlbert from the branch of an ancient tree.

Owlbert: [hops onto Eda's hand, hoots]

Eda: Oh, he's my palisman and we're bonded for life. [Owlbert hops to her shoulder, nuzzling her cheek] I'd annihilate anyone who'd hurt him.

King: Fine. Don't help. Revenge will taste all the sweeter if they fall by my hand alone. [laughs]

Usurper: [shoves King over] Tag, your it! [laughs and runs off]

Eda: Oh, man. Here we go. King's squeak of rage.

King: [stands] Nyeh! Nyeh! [squealing, pauses, continues squealing as he charges after his rival]

Eda: [laughs] He is like a little teakettle. [snorts]

[Owlbert scratches at his face.]

Luz: Hey, what's that? [points to Owlbert's foot]

Eda: That's his interlock. So he only fits on to my staff. Every palisman has one.

[As she speaks, everything but her, her staff, and the bench disappears.]

Eda: [gasps] Luz?

[She stands and looks around the void. Both her staff and the bench disappear.]

Eda: Hello?

Luz: [echoing] Eda?

Eda: Luz!

[The real world returns as Luz and Owlbert look over Eda.]

Luz: Eda! Eda! Wake up!

[Eda's eyes open. She is now laying down on the bench.]

Luz: Are you all right? [helps Eda up]

Eda: [shudders] What? Oh, no. The curse. Hey, we have to get home. Now! [picks up her staff and leaves]

Luz: King we have to go!

King: [atop the jungle gym, facing Usurper] Five more minutes, please!

Luz: King!

King: Ah, man. This isn't over.

Usurper: Okay, let's play again real soon. [hugs King]

King: No, no. Keep those sticky hands away! Oh, no! He's touching me! [screams]

-THEME SONG-

[Cut to the Owl House, where Eda tosses her staff to the couch.]

Eda: [yawns, flops facefirst onto the couch]

Luz: I'll go get your elixir.

Eda: [muffled] Don't worry about it. I'll get it myself in a bit.

Luz: Do you need me to stay home and take care of you? [gasps] I could put King in a little doctor's outfit.

[Everyone looks at King, who looks up from a stack of paper.]

King: Meh?

Eda: No one wants to see that.

Luz: I do.

Eda: Look, I know how to take care of myself. I've had this curse longer than you've been alive.

Luz: So, how'd you get it?

Eda: [grunts] I don't know.

Luz: You don't know?

Eda: Somebody gave it to me. I don't know who and I don't care because I'm fine, all right? Anyway, don't you have plans with Tweedledum and Twerpledee?

Luz: Well, Willow, Gus, and I are going to the grudgby game between Hexside and Glandus High.

Eda: [screws Owlbert back onto the staff] Since when are you into sports?

Luz: Since I found a little something called "Hexside Pride." [grunts] To think that Glandus, whoever they are, would dare face us. But if you need me to stay...

Eda: Gross. Sympathy. Go! Go have fun at sport.

Luz: Hooray! Hooray for sport! Hugs and kisses, King. [kisses his skull] Mwah! [sing-song] Don't spend all night plotting revenge.

King: [sing-song] That drooly‐faced heathen will know my wrath.

[Cut to Hexside, where students are lined up to get on a dragon bus. Luz is running toward it but not paying attention.]

Luz: Hexside's gonna wreck your side. [stops walking] Huh, no. [keeps walking] Hexside is the best side in the west side. [yelps]

Dragon Bus: [roars, bites at Luz]

Luz: [shudders] Ah! Friends.

Willow and Luz: Whoo‐hoo!

Gus: Game day roar!

Luz: Happy game day, fellow, uh... Are we Hexidians? Hexies? [gasps] Hexoleos?

Willow: Actually, most people call us... winners.

Gus: Grudgby games are the best. The players go through these action‐packed trials. And the audience gets to wave flags. Look, I practiced.

[He pulls out two flags, turns in a circle as he waves them and hums.]

Luz: [looks at her hoodie] Is it weird that I'm not wearing anything Hexside?

Willow: Um, it's weirder that you're wearing Glandus colors.

Giant Boy: Get ready to be creamed, Glandus nerd.

Luz: Hey! I'm a Hexside nerd. Gotta change out of this shirt. Where can I get a Hexside one?

Gus: I know. There's a lost and found box in the cafeteria.

Luz: Ah! The lost and found. Where mouthguards go to retire.

[Cut to the lost and found, a giant chest. Luz opens it and pulls out a hat.]

Luz: Yes!

[Cut to the front doors of Hexside, which Luz exits in full Hexside apparel waving pom-poms.]

Luz: Goooo, Hexside! [does a split] Well, I never did that before. Uh, where is everyone?

[The dragon bus is flying away.]

Giant Boy: Hexside rules!

Luz: Oh, no! Come back! Why didn't you guys board the bus?

Willow: We weren't going to leave you behind.

Gus: I was.

Willow: Gus! [elbows him]

Luz: Can we walk to Glandus?

Gus: We'd never make it in time. Glandus is... [rolls his flags, points with them] all the way out in the middle of the island.

Luz: [scoffs] Typical Glandus.

Willow: And my parents are working, otherwise I'd see if they could give us a ride on their staff.

Luz: A staff... because staffs fly. Of course. I can get us a staff.

Gus: You can?

Luz: Yes, come on.

[Luz grabs Willow's hand and runs. Gus leaps after them. Cut to the doors of Eda's bedroom.]

King: Eda! Great news. I thought of the perfect way to get revenge on that usurper. [holds out a piece of paper reading "FIRE?"] Now, don't be put off by the complicated premise. I'll break it down for you in small pieces. Huh?

[Eda, almost completely in her Owl Beast form, is sitting in her nest. She growls and advances on King.]

King: [screams, falls down] Owl Beast! [screams] Stay back!

Eda: [stops and backs up]

King: Did you just listen to me? [stands up] Uh, come here. Sit.

Eda: [takes step forward, snorts]

King: Oh, this is an interesting development.

Eda: [warbles]

King: Eda's only partially transformed which means she's totally suggestible. [chuckles] Yes. Yes! I think this will do nicely. Forget fire. I've got a greater force to unleash. You! You're going to help me regain my throne. I mean, if that's okay with you. Right?

Eda: [growls]

King: I'll take that weird grumble as a yes. I'm just gonna grab a little bottle of elixir in case you go rogue on me.

[He grabs a full bottle of elixir and a messenger bag. Several empty bottles fall out of the bag as he drags it.]

King: Now, to destiny's battlefield: the playground!

Luz: [offscreen] King, are you home?

Eda: [growls]

King: What? [to Eda] Sit. Stay.

Luz: Is Eda up?

King: [closes doors] Who? Oh. [chuckles] That Eda. No, no. She is out like a light.

Eda: [growls]

King: [chuckles] Oh, man. Can she snore.

Luz: Oh, no. I wanted to ask if I could borrow her staff but I know she needs her rest.

King: [grabs Eda's staff and gives it to Luz] Oh, I'm sure it's fine. It's fine. Just take it.

Luz: I can't. Not without Eda's permission.

Eda: [screams]

King: Well, there's your permission. Off you go.

Luz: I really owe Gus and Willow one. And it's just for the afternoon. I'm sure Eda wouldn't mind.

King: Not our generous, kindhearted Eda. Big heart on her.

[They stare at each other for a second.]

Luz: [starts to leave] I'll be back soon.

King: Close call.

Luz: [stops leaving] What?

King: Nothing.

Luz: Oh, okay. [leaves for real]

King: Close call. [opens the doors] And now revenge. Right, Owl Eda?

Eda: [munches a chair]

King: [chuckles] I'm feeling confident about this plan.

[Cut to the front of the Owl House as Luz opens the door.]

Luz: To Glandus High.

[She gestures with the staff, hitting Owlbert against the house.]

Owlbert: [hoots]

Luz: Oh! Sorry, Owlbert. It's okay. We're just on our way to help some friends.

Willow and Gus: Ooh!

Luz: Who's ready to board Air Luz?

[They all board the staff.]

Willow: Feel that power‐to‐weight ratio.

Gus: [to his flags] Boys, prepare to fly.

Luz: Next stop, Glandus High. Let's go.

[The staff rises in the air.]

Luz: Step on it, Owlbert.

[She slaps the staff.]

Owlbert: [squawks, rushes forward]

All: Whoa! Whoa!

[The staff does a loop-de-loop, then runs into several trees.]

All: [grunting] [scream]

[They hit a tree head on. Willow and Gus fall directly into a bush. Luz gets caught on a branch, then falls out of her Hexside sweater.]

Luz: [grunts]

[Owlbert falls directly on top of his head. He looks at his now cracked head and hoots.]

Luz: [groans, stands] Is everyone okay? Huh?

Owlbert: [hoots, twists himself off the staff, flies off]

Luz: Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no! Owlbert, come back!

[Cut to Luz, Willow, and Gus running through the forest.]

Luz: Owlbert!

[Owlbert hoots as he flies into a foreboding cave.]

All: [stop running, panting]

Gus: Man, humans can run. Must be their dorsal fins.

Luz: He went through those trees. Come on. [starts running]

Willow: [stops Luz] We have to be careful. It's really easy to get lost in this part of the forest.

Luz: This is Eda's palisman, Willow. She'll kill me if we don't get it back. Let's go.

[Cut to the inside of the cave. Bats screech as they enter. Bones crunch under their feet.]

Willow: Wow. I keep stepping on a lot of crunchy twigs.

Luz: Those are bones, Willow.

Willow: [looks up] Not if I never look down.

[A shadow passes them.]

All: [yelp, step closer together]

Luz: This isn't any kind of forest I'm used to. [pokes a spiderweb with the staff]

Willow: That's because this isn't a forest.

[The Bat Queen's kids chirp as they approach the teens.]

Willow: It's a nest.

Luz: Hey, I remember you. You're Bat Queen's babies.

Bat babies: [screeching]

Gus: Wait. The Bat Queen? [backs away]

Willow: [also backs away] I think I'd rather take my chances with Eda.

Luz: [walks towards the bats] Uh, we're looking for a little owl and... There he is.

[Owlbert is standing a bit behind the bat babies.]

Owlbert: [warbles, backs into the shadows]

Luz: Owlbert, thank goodness you're okay. Come here, buddy. Time to go home.

[The Bat Queen steps in front of Owlbert and into the light.]

All: [gasp]

Bat Queen: [hisses] Hello, small human.

[Cut to the Slayground.]

Kids: [chattering, laughing]

[One kid makes a sandcastle in the sandbox. Loud footsteps knock it down.]

Eda: [growls]

King: Ahem!

Eda: [growling]

[Eda, King on her back, is sitting on the roof of a house.]

King: Listen carefully. You all have two choices. Grovel or‐‐

Eda: [screeching]

Kids: [scream]

Braxas: Ah! A monster.

[The kids all flee.]

King: Good enough. Whoa!

[Eda jumps off the roof.]

Kids: [screaming]

King: Run! Despair!

Usurper: [whimpering]

King: Your time has ended. Mine begins.

Usurper: [crying, goes down the slide]

King: Not so tough now, you spongy hatchlings. I will eat you.

Eda: [growls]

King: [climbs the slide] All who stood in my way are gone. I declare myself despotic ruler of this land. Nothing can stop the almighty‐‐

[Crunch.]

King: Huh? Hmm?

[Eda is eating the slide.]

King: Hey. Whoa, whoa! No eating the throne.

[Eda looks longingly at the slide.]

King: Noooo!

Eda: [munches]

King: [whiny] Stop that!

[Cut back to the Bat Queen's nest.]

Bat Queen: [exhales]

Willow: It's the...

Luz: Bat Queen. I know. We kinda babysat her kids once. Don't worry. I got this. [to Bat Queen] Hiya, BQ. My, your hair is looking greasy. And your kids [chuckles] they're as hideous as ever.

Gus: You know, that coulda gone worse.

Bat Queen: [growls]

Luz: [chuckles] So... Owlbert ran away and I need to get him back. I'm just gonna grab him and we'll be on our way.

[Bat Queen puts a claw on Luz's chest.]

Luz: Ah!

Bat Queen: To be careless with a staff, it's very serious. I protect him.

Luz: And thank you for that, uh, but he belongs to Eda, the Owl Lady. [removes Bat Queen's claw] And you owe her a favor, remember?

Bat Queen: Owl Lady is careless. Her staff left her sight. Taken by human who steals, hurts, frightens...

Luz: Huh?

Bat Queen: He told me all.

[Bat Queen's eyes glow yellow. Owlbert's glow the same color.]

Luz: Owlbert, I never meant to hurt you. [kneels down] Please trust me.

Owlbert: [hoots, flies onto Bat Queen's head]

[Both their eyes glow again. Luz stands.]

Bat Queen: Trust must be earned... [flies to a perch] ...through trials!

[Fire bursts from the ground with the final word.]

Gus: [happily, waving flags] Trials?

Willow: Luz, the Bat Queen is well‐known for her impossible trials. I've never heard of anyone winning against her.

Luz: But I have to get Owlbert back. I accept your challenge.

Willow: And we'll be right there with you.

Gus: Let the flags raise you up.

[Bat Queen closes her claw. Webs encase Willow and Gus.]

Gus: Hey!

Willow: What?

Bat Queen: No helpsies. Now, let the trials begin. Milk the spider demon.

[A spider with udders approaches Luz, holding a bucket.]

Spider demon: [growling]

Luz: [grunts, looks at Owlbert]

Owlbert: [hoots, tilts his head]

Luz: All right. Come here, pal. Let's do this.

Spider demon: [runs, squealing]

Luz: If you run, you'll just make this harder for yourself.

[Cut to one of the flames extinguishing.]

Bat Queen: Remove bees nest.

[Luz climbs a tree, empty staff in hand. A giant buzzing bees nest is sitting in one of the branches. She raises the staff to smack the nest, but it turns into the head of a giant bee that screeches at her.]

Luz: [yelps]

[She falls out of the tree. Cut to her running past Willow and Gus, screaming, the bee screeching after her.]

Gus: Come on. Almost got it. [frees himself from the webs] I am free! Bat Queen, you will rue the day you tried to trap‐‐

[She traps him again, this time suspended from the ceiling.]

Gus: Aaah.

[A second flame goes out.]

Bat Queen: Give babies a bath!

[Cut to Luz scrubbing one baby bat, sitting on another, a third biting her shoulder. They're all covered in suds.]

Luz: [grunts]

Bat babies: [screeching]

Willow: Go, Luz.

Gus: Luz, we're here if you need us.

Willow: Yeah. Cut us free. We can get Eda.

Luz: No, I was selfish,

Bat babies: [screeching continues]

Luz: and I hurt Owlbert. I need to do this alone so he knows I care about him. [dumps barrel of water over the baby bats]

Bat babies: [screeching; turns around to show their hair neat and faces shiny]

Luz: Aw!

Bat babies: [shake their heads; return to normal and screech]

Luz: [screams]

[Cut to the Slayground, where Eda is eating a swing.]

King: No, no! Bad Eda! You are my beast and I control you. [punches her wing] Hey!

Eda: [growls]

King: [yelping] What was I thinking? I'm such a fool. I'm such a... [grabs the bottle bag]

Eda: [growling continues]

King: ...genius!

Eda: [snarls]

King: [grunts, throws bottle in her mouth]

Eda: [screeches, spits out cork]

King: Great. Now, change back to Eda.

Eda: [growling]

King: Anytime now. Just magically transform.

Eda: [snarls]

King: Ah, nuts.

[Eda shreds King's cardboard box armor seconds after he ducks out of it. He runs down the rope net.]

King: [grunting] Whoa!

Eda: [growls]

[A siren wails. Cut to a van reading "ANIMAL CONTROL". The demon hunters step out of it, now wearing reflective vests. Demon Hunter #1 steps off the van.]

Demon Hunter #2: Uh, this is so embarrassing.

Demon Hunter #1: Hey, hey. This job is all we have right now. So, I wanna see happy faces. Okay?

Demon Hunter #2: [thumbs up and sarcastic smile]

Demon Hunter #1: Let's roll out.

Demon Hunter #2: [sticks out their tongue]

King: Ah! Animal control.

Demon Hunter #1: Matches the description the parents called in. Bag it.

King: Oh, no! No, no, no!

Eda: [stalks toward them, growls]

[The demon hunters combine spells to create a large green net. Eda tries to jump out of it.]

Eda: [screeching]

[The net shrinks to fit Eda. Demon Hunter #1 shocks her.]

King: [yelping]

[Eda falls to the ground. Demon Hunter #1 lifts her away.]

King: Eda!

[Eda is put into the animal control van. The doors close behind her. King tries to free himself from the rope net.]

King: [grunting] Whoa! Awesome. Fantastic.

[Cut back to Bat Queen's nest. The third flame goes out. Gus frees himself from the web again, landing in a handstand.]

Gus: Yes, I am free again. I--

[Webs encase him yet again. He screams, muffled, and waves his legs.]

Luz: Okay, Bat Queen. That's the last one. I've done all your chores. And I've proved my dedication to Owlbert. I'm so sorry for the pain I caused you, Owlbert. I promise to be more careful. Will you come back home with me?

[Owlbert nods and hoots. He flies off of Bat Queen's perch to the ground. Bat Queen raises her claw, and webs encase Owlbert.]

Owlbert: [squawks]

Bat Queen: No! More trails. Last trial. You must face... me.

[She expands her wings, a jet of flames going up behind her.]

Luz: What?

Bat Queen: [roars, flies forward]

Luz: [yelping, runs]

Bat Queen: You will never get him back!

Luz: [grunts]

Willow: Luz, get us out. We can help.

[Luz frees Willow. Willow frees Gus.]

Willow: Look out!

Bat babies: [screeching]

Gus: I'll hold'em off with my flags.

Bat babies: [screeching, attack Willow and Gus]

Gus: No! That was a bad plan.

[Cut to Luz sneaking off.]

Luz: [yelps]

Bat Queen: [roaring]

[Bat Queen chases Luz through the forest. Owlbert squawks as he frees a wing from the web. Cut to Luz running.]

Luz: I won't let you imprison Owlbert.

Bat Queen: [roars]

Luz: [grunting, trips]

Bat Queen: [roars]

Luz: [gasps, grunts]

[Bat Queen flies down to attack Luz. She stops her claws with the staff.]

Bat Queen: [roaring]

Luz: [gasps] Is that an interlock? [kicks the staff and Bat Queen away] Bat Queen, you used to be on a staff, didn't you? You were a Palisman.

Bat Queen: [gasps]

[Cut to the Slayground, where King is still stuck in the net.]

King: Nyeh! [frees himself] Oof.

Usurper: Your pride has destroyed you. The throne belongs to me now.

King: Over my dead body.

Eda: [screeching]

King: Eda!

Usurper: Yes, leave and forfeit your reign.

King: Well, then, forfeit I shall. [runs] I'm coming for you, Eda. [panting] Huh?

Eda: [screeching]

[The animal control van is stuck at a snail road crossing. A giant snail with windows in its shell is slowly making its way across.]

Eda: [screeching continues]

[King runs to the animal control van. He hefts himself into the back through a window.]

Eda: [snorting]

King: You in there, Eda?

Eda: [snarls]

King: Eda, I'm sorry. I used you for your strength 'cause I felt weak. I'm your friend. If only there were some way to remind you who I am.

Eda: [growls, snarls]

King: Wait a sec. Eda loves my rage squeal. Like this... [grunting] [squealing]

Eda: [snorts, laughs] [snarls] So tiny. So angry. [laughing] [growls, grunts, turns back to normal] [groans]

King: Eda, you're back. [hugs her]

Eda: What happened?

King: Okay, so I went to your room and you were the beast. And then... And then I woke up here one second before you did.

Eda: Uh‐huh. I'll deal with you later. But for now, you wanna bounce?

King: Yes, please.

[Eda explodes the back of the van.]

Demon Hunter #1: Aah! Where did it go? [to Eda] Hey, lady. H‐Have you seen a monster that kinda looks like you? Lady!

[Eda walks off with King under her arm. Cut to the forest.]

Luz: You were once a Palisman, weren't you?

[Bat Queen looks at her claw with the interlock on it. She turns away from Luz.]

Bat Queen: Yes, I was once part of a grand staff. A staff made for a giant. But I was broken, discarded.

Luz: So, that's why you're so protective of Owlbert.

Bat Queen: I protect... all!

[Her eyes glow again. Behind her, dozens of other eyes begin glowing.]

Luz: [gasps]

[Countless broken and scarred palismen of every type are in the trees.]

Bat Queen: I made home in forest. I'm here to take the lost. The forgotten.

Luz: I understand. But Owlbert is not forgotten. He has someone at home who loves him very much.

Bat Queen: [turns and walks away] He will not go back with you.

Luz: That's not your decision to make.

Bat Queen: [turns back around] I won't let him.

Luz: [gasps, braces for attack]

Owlbert: [protecting Luz, hoots]

[His eyes glow. A second later, so do Bat Queen's.]

Bat Queen: You...

[Wind howling.]

Bat Queen: You care for her.

Owlbert: [nods, hoots] [nuzzles Luz, warbling]

Bat Queen: Very well. Go. And take your friends.

[Willow and Gus, still being attacked by the bat babies, run in.]

Bat Queen: [whistles]

Bat Babies: [screeching, flies to Bat Queen]

Gus: I don't think I'll ever be clean again.

[Owlbert grabs Eda's staff and brings it to Luz. Gus wipes the bat babies' spit off of him.]

Luz: Bat Queen, do you know what happened to your owner?

Bat Queen: It has been thousands of years. I've forgotten.

Luz: If you ever want to search for the truth, I'll help you.

Bat Queen: Thank you. [flies away]

Willow: I can't believe you took on the Bat Queen. [hugs Luz]

Gus: [dances] And we're not dead.

Luz: Thank you for helping me get Owlbert back. I'm sorry we missed the game.

Gus: Are you kidding? That was better than any grudgby match. There were action‐packed trials. I got to do my flag wave, and I'm slightly traumatized. Hooray!

Luz: [chuckles] Let's get this little guy home.

[Cut to the Owl House, where Luz is putting a bandage on Owlbert's cracked head.]

Luz: And now you're a part of the boo‐boo buddy club.

Owlbert: [hoots]

Eda: Owlbert, why are you off the staff?

Owlbert: [hoots, flies over to Eda] [warbling]

Eda: Luz took you to get ice cream? Aw, that's... a horrible lie.

Owlbert: [hoots]

Luz: [gulps]

Eda: Well, lucky for you both I don't care right now. I'm going to take a nap. [walks off]

King: I'll, uh, be at the playground. [walks away]

[Owlbert flies back to Luz's shoulder.]

Luz: [to Owlbert] We'll keep this one to ourselves, shall we?

Owlbert: [warbling, nuzzles Luz's cheek again]

[Cut to Eda's room, where four empty elixir bottles are sitting on her side table.]

Eda: [coughing, picks up a bottle] The elixir... It isn't working on the curse anymore. This is bad. [coughing, vomits] When did I swallow a swing?

[Cut to Bat Queen's nest, where she is chasing her kids.]

Bat Queen: Babies. To bed.

Bat Babies: [land on a branch, chirping] [soft screeching]

Bat Queen: And now it's time to have book before sleeping. [burps]

[She takes a book out of her mouth. Instead of reading it, she rips off pages and feeds them to her kids.]

Bat Babies: [soft screeching] [soft screeching continues]

Bat Queen: Yes, consume. Grow wise.

Baby Bat: [swallows]

Bat Queen: Avoid paper cuts.

[The babies fall asleep. Bat Queen sits on the branch behind them. It's revealed that they are upside down.]
