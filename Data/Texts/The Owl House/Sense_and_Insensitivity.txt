[Open on Eda's Human Collectibles stand in the market. King holds up a tray of mostly inedible human things.]
King: Partake of my free snack samples! Take it! I demand it as your ruler, the King of Demons!
[Several people pass but none even look at him. He throws the tray on the ground.]
King: Nyeh! Why isn't anyone paying attention to me? I'm their rightful overlord. Intellectually and such.
Eda: Yeah...hey! [grabs a passerby by the cowl, sniffs] It reeks more of nerd than money today.
Luz: Guys!
Passerby: Ah!
Luz: You will not believe what's going on! [poses under a banner] It's a book fair! Where books come to life!
[A book jumps off one of the stands next to her.]
Book: Hello.
Luz: [screams and kicks it]
King: A fair without rides?
Boy: Who needs rides when this [shoves a book in King's face] can take you anywhere?
King: Nyeh.
[King throws a strip of bacon on the boy's head. A winged demon flies by and picks him up. The boy screams.]
Eda: A, ew. [throws book on the ground] B, I'm bored. C, I feel like pickpocketing some dork while they browse. [walks off]
Luz: No, wait! [to King] Will you give it a chance? I'll let you ride in my hoodie! [puts her hood up]
King: Ooohoohoohoo!
[Cut to Luz walking through the book fair with King in her hood.]
Luz: This book fair's got everything! A zine-making workshop, meet and greets, and- what's that? [gasp] A writing competition!? I've always wanted to be a writer.
King: Writer? What? I thought you wanted to be a witch?
Luz: Of course I wanna be a witch. But where I'm from that's kinda... impossible. So my runner up dream was to be a writer. [pulls a picture out of her pocket] I've had this about the author picture since I was seven years old. I know my good angle. I'm gonna enter the competition.
Bo: [laughs as she runs by]
King: Ugh! What are these basement dwellers doing out in natural sunlight?
Tiny Nose: Um! We're in line for Jon De Plume, most famous writer on the Boiling Isles, famed author of the Realm Warriors series! I'm gonna have him read my story... and marry me.
[Cut to Jon signing a book.]
Man: Jon, will you sign my child?
Jon: I'll sign anything! [laughs evilly]
King: Such power. Such command he holds over his minions. I must have the same! Luz the human! I too shall enter the competition.
Luz: Really? [gasps] We could work together! It'll be perfect! We're best friends, so we'll make the best team!
King: Team! Yes!
[Luz begins walking away.]
King: My name goes first on the cover.
-THEME SONG-
[Indistinguishable chatter.]
Eda: [grabs books and tosses it] Boring, [knocks books onto a child's head] boring. [grabs another book] Boring. [gasps as she looks in a mirror] Another wrinkle! The curse is quickening!
Lilith: You, lackey.
[Eda ducks behind a banner that says "READ OR... DIE". She lifts the banner and glares at Lilith.]
Eda: Lilith...
Lilith: Do you have the item we discussed?
Merchant: Oh! Yes, right here. [hands her a map]
Lilith: [opens it] This is excellent. A map to the Bloom of Eternal Youth. I think the emperor will be very pleased.
Steve: Ma'am, shouldn't we be searching for the Owl Lady to join the coven? Remember that whole plan.
Lilith: [laughs] My sister's curse has left her frail. She'll still be here when we get back.
Eda: [groans]
Lilith: This comes first, it's for the emperor after all.
Steve: Yeah! [knocks over the merchant's books] All hail the emperor!
Lilith: Very good, Steve! [walks away]
Steve: Shoulder pats for Steve! [walks away]
Eda: [jumps a table] Hey bub, what'd you sell my prissy sister?
Merchant: Oh! It's a map to the Bloom of Eternal Youth. A rare flower that only grows once a millennia. Like the name says, it gives eternal youth to whomever holds it.
Eda: Interesting. So Lilith wants to nab this power for the emperor, huh. Well, won't she be surprised when I get there first and get it for myself! Hah! That'll show her who's frail.
Merchant: [grins maliciously] Well, we'll see won't we. [opens a drawer to reveal dozens of maps] Can't go without a map of course.
[He hands Eda one. She takes it and opens it, grinning.]
[Cut to Luz's room in the Owl House, where she puts down a large corkboard.]
Luz: Now, let's write down some ideas that we want to see in the story.
King: I can write anything?
Luz: Yeah! [hands him notecards and a crayon] We're brainstorming, every idea is a good idea.
King: [writing] Mhm! Done! [pins up paper that says "VIOLENCE"]
Luz: Aw, is that all you want to see?
King: [holds up paper that says "BLOOD :)"]
Luz: Hmm.
[Cut to later, with the corkboard mostly full of notecards. Luz pins up three more, reading what's on them as she goes.]
Luz: Romance! Magic! Heartbreak with shimmer tears. And, the main character is, of course, ahhh, Luzura! [holds up a card with a drawing of herself wearing a pointed hat] I know it's kind of cliché, but what's wrong with cliché?
[She pins her character card to the board. King pins his, a stick figure drawing of himself, next to it.]
King: Nyeh! And my main character is the King...err...the Ruler of Demons! With this totally original, all-star cast, victory will be ours!
[Luz puts a typewriter onto a desk and sits behind it.]
Luz: Now for the easy part.
[Cue montage. King stares at the corkboard, now with "ACT 1", "ACT 2", and "ACT 3" on larger notecards in the middle. Luz puts a giant piece of paper over the acts of a drawing of Luzura and Ruler standing in front of an explosion. King and Luz high-five. Cut to Luz writing the following on a chalkboard: "Step 1: Find Cat. Step 2: Endanger Cat. Step 3: Shave Cat (???). Step 4: Book Complete." King nods. Cut to the chalkboard now hanging up and reading "STORY STRUCTURE" with a circle on it, a line cutting it in half, with the numbers 1-8 on it. King gestures to it several times. Luz draws a face on the circle. They both grin. Cut to the floor littered with paper, most of them scribbled over with red. Luz is typing and King is pacing while reading. A banner above them reads "Luzura's Awakening."]
King: "Luzura's tears fell on the frozen prince, bringing him back to life." Ehhh it just seems kind of unrealistic.
Luz: I see what you're saying. [stops typing] But in your version, Ruler just destroys everything. I think a little romantic tension could help the scene.
King: Hey, there's more to life than shipping.
Luz: Don't you dare insult shipping in my presence!
Eda: [offscreen] Apprentice! Living room!
Luz: I'll be back, we'll figure this out, okay writing buddy? [Luz leaves]
King: [looks at the typewriter] My turn to write!
[Cut to the living room, where Eda is looking at the map.]
Luz: Hey!
[Eda closes the map.]
Luz: What's up, boss lady?
Eda: I am popping out for a few days to an undisclosed place to do undisclosed things. You're in charge.
Luz: Great!
Eda: No questions!
Luz: Okay!
Eda: I said no questions! [closes the door]
[Luz shrugs. Cut back to her room.]
Luz: Well King, it's just you and me for a while. [gasps]
[In the minute she's been gone, King has transformed the room. Drawings of King and screaming people are on the corkboard. Luzura is now in the trash. King is typing peacefully.]
King: Hey hey Luz, great news!
Luz: What have you done?!
[Even the banner has been changed, now reading "RULER'S REACH".]
King: I just made a few tiny edits and this baby is humming!
Luz: [picks up drawing] Luzura dies?
King: I know, right! What a twist!
Luz: King, I know you're trying to help, but I think you're crossing a line.
King: Yeah, into greatness. Don't you want us to win?
Luz: If this is how you want to win, maybe you should submit the story on your own. [leaves]
King: What?
[Door closes.]
King: Bah! What does she know?
Typewriter: What the heck, man? Learn to collaborate.
King: Hush, you! I'll prove to both of you my story is superior.
[Cut to Grimgrub's Pub. King bursts in.]
King: Hey you scum! Which one of you wants to read my literary masterpiece! Anyone brave enough?
Patrons: [growl]
[King is thrown out of the pub.]
King: Oof!
[His book is thrown out and hits him in the head.]
King: Nyah! Ugh.
Piniet: I'll read your story. [takes King's book, reads it fast] You wrote this?
King: Yup, that's me! Only me.
Piniet: Let me get you a fruit punch.
King: Ooh. I love punching.
[Cut to inside. Piniet snaps. A glass of fruit punch is slid on the counter toward King.]
Piniet: I'm Piniet, of Piniet Publishing House. And your name is... King?
King: It's more of a rank than a name.
Piniet: I loved your story, so much better than the submissions we got for the competition. I want to buy it and publish it for everyone to read. I'll make you as famous as Jon De Plume.
[Camera pans to Jon De Plume getting cheered on by fans as he does finger guns. He falls backwards, and Amelia and Skara rush to act as a chair for him.]
King: I've always wanted a people chair! I'm in! This will be my first step in my reclamation of power!
Piniet: [pulls a contract out of his jacket] Then all you have to do is sign here.
[Piniet puts the contract on the counter. King dunks his paw in the punch and smacks it on the signature line. The contract glows when Piniet picks it up. He rolls it and puts it back in his jacket.]
King: You're ominous. And I like it.
Piniet: Get ready to be famous, Mr. King.
[They shake hands.]
[Cut to a forge, where creatures are jumping on a bellow. A witch pulls a molten ball out of the fireplace. They strike it with a hammer, then cool it in a barrel. The cooled chunk smashes on a table, revealing King's book. Cut to a cartful of the books arriving at a bookstore. Mattholomule takes a bundle of them out and tosses it on the welcome mat, which carries it inside.]
Welcome Mat: Ouch! Jeez.
[Cut to the market.]
Reviewnicorn: It's the perfect blend of heart and heartlessness! Like two authors mashed into one! [neighs]
[Cut to the library, where a cardboard cutout of King is leaning against a stand of Ruler's Reaches. A crowd comes and goes, leaving no book behind. Skara returns to kiss and steal the cardboard cutout. Cut to King wearing a jacket, scarf, and sunglasses as he walks the streets of Bonesborough, past bookstores and loaded shelves.]
King Cardboard Cutout: Spend money on my thing I wrote. Spend money on my thing I wrote.
Crowd: [gasps] Oh my God! it's the King, I can't believe it!
[The crowd tosses King into the air. More people arrive, waving their copies of Ruler's Reach and pens.]
Tiny Nose: Mr. King! I love your writing. Please read my story!
King: [laughs] Oh my, always good to meet minions. I mean fans. [signs Tiny Nose's story and throws it back at her]
Tiny Nose: You're my inspiration.
[Cut to the forest. Eda walks into a clearing, consulting her map. She rips vines off of a statue.]
Eda: Okay, from the Minitaur, I head due north, and with luck, I'll get to the Bloom of Eternal Youth before Lilith! [laughs, snorts] Who's frail now, emperor dorks?
[Branch cracks.]
Eda: [gasps] Someone's following me.
[With a snap, she summons a blue sword. She ducks behind the statue. Lilith walks into the clearing, looking worse for wear. Eda summons a fireball and runs out from behind the statue.]
Eda: Spicy toss!
Lilith: Aah!
Eda: Lilly?
Lilith: Edalyn?
[Eda vanishes both of her weapons.]
Lilith: [sighs] And of course you would be here just to be a nuisance. Why don't you go home and rest? Wouldn't want you breaking a hip.
Eda: Sorry sister, I'm stronger than you think. I'm here to save the Bloom of Eternal Youth from the likes of you. [runs; singsong] And I'm gonna get there before you!
Lilith: Aah! No you won't!
[Cut to Luz's room. Luz is writing on the typewriter.]
King: Hey, Luz!
[Luz looks up and glares at King.]
King: Guess who won the writing competition and became a blockbuster writer superstar?
[He slides into the room while Luz resumes typing.]
King: You're right, it's me! Me! Do you wanna touch my scarf? A fan crocheted it out of their own hair! It smells so bad!
[Luz continues typing.]
King: My publisher is throwing a huge party for my book, Ruler's Reach. [puts an invitation on the table] And I, uh, I'd like for you to be there
[Luz sweeps the invitation off the table. It hits the floor and she continues typing.]
King: Alright, fine! Be that way I guess.
[King leaves. Luz stops typing and looks up.]
Luz: [sighs]
Typewriter: Girl, you don't need him.
Luz: But I don't want to be mad at him either.
[She picks up the invitation and opens it. Inside is a golden paper that says "MEET THE AUTHOR TONIGHT ONLY @ BONESBOROUGH LIBRARY". A picture of King in a blue sweater is in the middle.]
[Cut to the library, which has an extensive line outside of it. Inside, King and Piniet are sitting at a table.]
Fan: Your fans are dying to know when Ruler's Reach 2 comes out!
King: That's between me and my publisher, right Piniet?
Piniet: Yes. Ooh pardon me, I need a few moments of King's time.
[Piniet walks off. King looks back at his fans and throws a peace sign, making them scream. Cut to the aisle in front of the romance section.]
King: Where's Jon De Plume at? I wanted to compare sunglasses.
Piniet: Oh he's taking a break to finish his latest masterpiece. Fame can really box you in, you know? Uh, speaking of, how's your second book coming along?
King: Coming along? Or finished! [pulls out a manuscript] Bam! Haha! Ruler's Reach 2 - now with more swears!
Piniet: Ahhh! Splendid! [reads story] Oh you cad! Not only are you a great writer, but a practical joker as well!
King: That's true- wait, what?
Piniet: Oh, this is truly awful! Looking forward to the real draft. [hands manuscript back and walks away]
King: Truly awful? But I'm a best-selling writer. How?
[Luz enters the library, looking generally disinterested.]
King: Luz! I can't write without her!
[King runs up to Luz.]
King: Luz, buddy! I'm so glad you could make it!
Luz: Hey King, I didn't wanna be angry at your success. You're my friend. So, congratulations!
King: Great to hear, 'cause I really need your help with my next book!
Luz: Huh?
King: Apparently I can't write my daring works of genius without rebelling against your gushy fantasy slop!
Luz: [blushes] Excuse me?
King: We make a great team! So, here's a pen. Writey writey, clock's a-tickin'!
[Luz takes the pen and drops it, making the gathered crowd gasp.]
Luz: I'm not writing for you after you made fun of all my ideas!
King: Hey! What the heck?
Luz: [turns to go] Congratulations on all your hard earned success. [leaves]
King: What am I gonna do? I can't write without her!
Piniet: [listening behind a bookcase] Hmm...
[Cut to the forest. Eda and Lilith both run by, panting. A shadow follows them.]
Eda: Ha! Doesn't this remind you of how we used to race to the kitchen, Lilly? Lilly?
Lilith: Mmm! Mmm!
[The camera pans up to show Lilith, wrapped up, being held by a crab-like monster. The monster growls as Lilith tries to free herself.]
Eda: Lilly!
[Eda summons a large fireball. The crab monster goes flying into the distance. Lilith falls into a bush with a muffled yell. Eda helps her up.]
Eda: Alley-Oop!
Lilith: Ugh, thank you Edalyn! I wasn't certain that you'd save me.
Eda: Stow it! Ugh, we might fight, but you're still my sister. And besides, if someone's gonna be putting you down, it's gonna be me. Ha! [slaps Lilith's back]
Lilith: [chuckles; looks to the side, gasps] Is that?
[Eda presses her face to Lilith's. Through the trees, a glowing pink flower looms.]
Eda: The Bloom of Eternal Youth! [pushes Lilith] Alright back off, that baby's mine.
Lilith: [growls] Why are you always like this?
Eda: Because Lilith, you think I'm just some tired old biddy. Ah, but I'm more than that. [magically cuts the flower] And with the Bloom of Eternal Youth's power, I'll show you!
[The flower disappears from her hand.]
Eda: What the-
Merchant: [maniacal laughter]
[The merchant's shadow falls over Eda as he stands atop the stone behind the flower. Lilith walks up next to Eda.]
[Cut to the library, where Luz is going toward the exit. She sees one of the many posters of King around the building.]
Luz: [sighs] They got his good angle.
[A shadow falls over her. Two large reptilian-like guards are in front of her.]
Luz: Uh, can I help you?
[The guards step aside to reveal Piniet.]
Piniet: Perhaps. I hear you're an aspiring writer.
Luz: [nervously laughs]
[Cut to the theater in the covention center. The stands are packed. Hanging in the center of the theater is a towering banner for Ruler's Reach 2.]
Crowd: King! King! King!
Boy: I can't wait for the sequel!
Amelia: If it's disappointing in any way, I will spend every day of my life trashing it!
[Cut to King looking at the audience nervously from behind a curtain.]
King: Oh boy. [paces] Oh, man, Aw jeez. [hems and haws] Hemming. Hawing. Piniet, I gotta come clean. We can't announce book two. I can't write without... without...
Piniet: Without your writing partner?
[Piniet smirks evilly. He and King enter a dressing room. Luz is inside, in a translucent purple box.]
Luz: [gasps] King!
King: Luz! [runs up to her]
Luz: That snappily dressed lizard trapped me in this shrinking box.
[Piniet tightens his fist. The box shrinks and hits Luz in the head.]
Luz: [screams and falls] You gotta get me out!
King: [to Piniet] What are you doing with her? Let her go!
Piniet: You wrote Ruler's Reach together. So if you don't want her crushed, you'll write together again.
[Luz and King both give him kicked-puppy looks.]
Piniet: Oh, don't give me that look. Some of the best books were written in literal crunch time.
[The box shrinks again.]
Luz: [yelps] That's a toxic mentality that contributes to burnout and unrealistic expectations! King, do something!
King: [growls] Set her free, now!
Piniet: Not until I get my best-seller. You'll recall you are under contract.
[Piniet pulls the contract out of his jacket. The paper glows. King floats.]
King: Ah! Nyeh!
[A hole opens in the box.]
Luz: Ah! [backs away from the hole]
[King is flung through the hole.]
King: Oof!
Piniet: [drops paper and a pen into the box] Make your deadline, or you'll never be able to hold a pen again. Just like...
[Piniet holds up Jon De Plume, now shrunk into a cube.]
Jon De Plume: Help me!
King: No!
[Piniet opens a briefcase, in which are dozens of other cubed authors. They scream for help.]
Author #1: Help us!
Author #2: Get us out of here!
[Piniet puts Jon De Plume into an empty slot and closes the briefcase.]
Piniet: I'll leave you to it. [leaves] Looking forward to your next volume! [closes the door]
[The box shrinks again.]
Luz and King: [gasp]
King: We're not getting out of here until we write a book, and that'll take forever! We're cube meat!
Luz: Well, I have my story.
King: But it's all hugging and crying! I can't put my name on that.
Luz: King, that is why we are in here! Because YOU, can't compromise! [turns around] All I wanted was to write a dumb story with my friend.
King: Luz, you're living your dream. You're becoming a witch. But this celebrity is as close as I'll ever get to my dream. It all went to my head, and I hurt you. I'm sorry.
Luz: Hey, [puts a hand on King's shoulder] being with you is one of my favorite parts of this dream.
[The box shrinks again.]
Luz: [yelps] I have a plan. But we need to work together this time.
King: Just tell me what to do.
[Cut to the forest.]
Merchant: I know you must be confused. The Bloom of Eternal Youth, dead? What if I told you the Bloom never existed at all! And now that I have led you to my nest, I'll suck all the life out of you to satisfy my unending hunger!
Lilith: He scammed us. Can you believe he scammed us?
Eda: I thought there was a 50/50 chance going in. Hard not to admire the tenacity though.
Lilith: Good entrance, but that outfit? Ha!
Eda: Look at his little shoes! [laughs]
Lilith: [laughing] Stop it.
Merchant: [covers his shoes] Well, maybe you've never been led into a lethal trap before, but the response should be, "Aa! No! Spare us!"
[Eda and Lilith share a look.]
Eda: Ah, sure. [steps onto the dais] Spare us.
Lilith: [summons her staff] Woe to us whose fates are sealed.
Eda: [cracks knuckles]
Merchant: Tha-That's right, witches! Cower! Cower? [gulps]
[Cut to the covention hall, where Piniet is stacking the cubed authors into a tower. The tower falls.]
Piniet: Aw, dang.
King: Hey Piniet! We're done!
[The door to the dressing room opens. The box is now so small King has to be under Luz's legs, which are bent in order to fit.]
Piniet: Faster than I expected!
King: That's the miracle of teamwork!
[A hole opens in the top of the box. Luz holds up her manuscript: Luzura and the Shimminger Tears of Love + Hate. "+ Hate" is added in red while the rest is blue. Piniet takes it and flips through part of it. The box shrinks slightly.]
Piniet: This is much more gushy than your last book.
King: Skip to the finale, because it is quite a payoff.
[Piniet rolls his eyes. He keeps reading. Luz and King prepare to move. Piniet gets to the last page.]
Piniet: What is this all about?
[He flips it around to reveal a light glyph drawn on the last page.]
Luz: Light spell!
[Luz reaches through the hole in the box and activates the glyph. The manuscript catches fire and turns into a blinding ball of light that rapidly disappears.]
Piniet: Ugh!
King: Ugh, I just realized I should've said enlightening. "Skip to the finale, you'll find it enlightening."
Luz: King! The contract!
[King's contract is hanging out of Piniet's pocket.]
King: Pretentious scarf, go!
[King uses the scarf as a lasso and pulls Piniet toward them. Luz grabs the contract and rips it in half with her teeth. The box explodes.]
Piniet: I made you a star, and this is how you repay me?
King: No, this is!
[King opens Piniet's briefcase. The cubed authors jump out and attack Piniet, screaming. Luz runs past, carrying King. They run into the two reptilian guards at the door. Piniet frees himself of the authors.]
Piniet: You are making this harder than it needs to be! And believe me, I am being very patient! [steps on a cubed author] But let's...
[Piniet pulls a pen from his jacket. He pops the cap off and presses a button. The nib of the pen extends into a large two headed battle axe, which he raises above his head.]
Piniet: ...cut to the finish.
[The doors are burst open, sending the guards flying.
All: [looking at the door] Huh?
Tiny Nose: King! I am your biggest fan! [runs over a guard, stands between King and Piniet] And I fought my way back here for you...to read my story?
King: I'm sorry, my lawyer advised me not to look at unsolicited work.
Tiny Nose: But... but... eep!
Piniet: [takes her story] Ugh! If I read this, will you go? So I can annihilate them in peace?
Tiny Nose: Of course!
[Piniet tosses his battle axe, adjusts his glasses, and slowly reads. Luz and King look at each other, then one of the guards. The guard shrugs. Piniet finishes the story. He's nearly crying.]
Piniet: Oh, it's beautiful! You, you must let me publish this! I can make you a star!
Tiny Nose: Really!
King: Wait a minute. What about King?
Piniet: Ugh! [takes King's jacket] You're old news. She on the other hand is the future! [drapes King's jacket and sunglasses over Tiny Nose]
Author #3: Whoo-hoo!
Author #4: Freedom!
King: Hey!
Luz: King! We're good then?
Piniet: [waves them away] Yes, quite.
[Luz picks King up and backs out of the dressing room.]
Tiny Nose: [shoots off finger guns] Pachew, pachew.
[Cut to the forest, where the merchant is beat up.]
Eda: Well, we wrecked this chump. But I guess the Bloom of Eternal Youth isn't real. [sighs]
Lilith: Well, if it makes any difference, I don't consider you to be a tired old bitty.
Eda: Really?
Lilith: If you were, you'd be much easier to catch.
Eda: Oh great, you're gonna cart me away to the coven now, are you?
Lilith: Not now. Because I want to give you a chance to join on your own! Join me in the Emperor's Coven, Edalyn. [holds out her hand] He could even heal your curse.
Eda: [pushes Lilith's hand down] No, I'll heal it on my own terms. I don't wanna owe him anything. Catch you later, sis.
Lilith: Not if I catch you first.
Eda: [smiles; summons her staff] I'll see you around. [flies off]
Lilith: [sighs]
Merchant: You're welcome for the chance to bond.
Lilith: [shoots him with a fire spell]
Merchant: [yells]
[Cut to the Owl House as Eda lands outside. Luz and King are snoring on the couch until Eda opens the door.]
Eda: Hey, kids. Woof. [drops her staff, cracks her back] That was a rough couple days.
Luz: Yeah, I'll say.
Eda: [sits on the couch] Ah. Well, nothing a bit of apple blood and a good book can't mend.
Luz: Books?
King: Nope, I don't know nothing about that.
Luz: We hate books. Wow, look at the time!
King: What's a book? Good night!
[Luz does a back-handspring out of the room while King just runs away. Eda watches them go, then notices Ruler's Reach on the coffee table.]
Eda: Huh? What the-
Typewriter: Girl, you do not want to know.
