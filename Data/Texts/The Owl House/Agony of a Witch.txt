[Open on the Emperor's Castle. Cut to a flag bearing the sign of the Emperor's Coven. Wild Witches are being brought across the drawbridge on a paddy wagon, most hidden in shadow, the ones we do see looking resigned to their fate. Something explodes out of the castle's chimney. Lilith is watching the procession from atop the castle walls, then turns and heads inside. Cut to Lilith approaching a stained glass window of Emperor Belos, robed witches bowing at his feet while a Hand of the Titan reaches for the sun behind them.]

Lilith: I haven't forgotten what you've promised me. I will bring you my sister, Emperor Belos.

Kikimora: [behind Lilith] Then why the delay?

Lilith: [turns around in surprise] Kikimora!

Kikimora: The Day of Unity is fast approaching, and other teams have bound many rogue witches to covens, and yet The Owl Lady still roams free. Are you... protecting her?

Lilith: Rest assured, Kiki. I have everything under control. [snaps fingers and guards approach upon command] Today, we capture Eda, once and for all.

-THEME SONG-

[Cut to the Owl House, where Hooty is fast asleep.]

Hooty: [snoring] Hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot...

Lilith: [from bushes outside of the house] Good. That infernal house demon is asleep. [beckons at the guards as they ready their weapons] Surround the house! 

[The guards go off in different directions.]

Hooty: Sleepwalking...sleepwalking [wakes up] Sleep-hooting!

[Hooty slams his face into the ground, popping up behind Lilith.]

Hooty: Hiya, Lilith! Peek-a-hoot! [smashes Lilith into a tree]

Lilith: [grunts]

[The guards charge.]

Hooty: Sorry! Eda doesn't like trespassers, but I'm always here to make new friends! Hoot! [bonks guard on the head and wears guard armor] Oh! Look at me! I'm a person now. Wobbly, wobbly! Ooh, blackout! [punches other guard] Hoot hoot! [throws guard armor away] Hoot hoot! Bye, friend! Ooh! I feel like dancing! [shakes body to hit the guards] Hoot! 

Lilith: [grunts]

[Lilith grabs her staff and stands. Hooty is bobbing in front of a tree. Lilith takes aim and fires.]

Hooty: I did it! [bends down and dodges Lilith's spell] Oh hey! Look, it's a bug!

[The spell slices through the tree, which falls toward Lilith. She just misses it, then collapses on the ground.]

Hooty: Aww! Just an old leaf! Well, that's good too. [eats leaf; making loud chewing noises]

[From inside the Owl House: Eda, who is wearing a yellow scarf, watches Hooty fighting the guards through her binoculars.]

Eda: Hooty! Ah, you're a thorn in my side [takes a cup of tea as a coven guard is slammed into the window] but you always dig your way into my heart.

[Luz is intrigued by what's brewing in Eda's cauldron.]

Luz: Ooh, magic 'sghetti. [tries to touch it]

Eda: Hey! [magically slaps Luz's hand with the spoon] That 'sghetti is Witch's Wool. It repels powerful spells. [holds up some of the wool] Every witch worth their salt has a cloak made from this stuff.

Luz: [stares at the wool adoringly] I'm worth salt... I want cloak! 

[Luz tries to grab the cauldron but Eda pulls it away from her.]

Eda: Easy, kid! With the Emperor's goons at my doorstep, I need this for protection. They have really stepped up their attacks lately.

Luz: [stares at her intensely] I think I finally understand why the Emperor wants you so badly. [jokingly] He's got the hots for you, doesn't he?

Eda: [fingerguns] Uh, but no. Emperor Belos wants to control all wild magic through his coven system. He ordered my capture years ago because I refuse to fall in line. 

Luz: And he won't stop until he's got you... [droops head]

Eda: Awww, don't sound so worried. I'm a master escape artist. The only thing that can slow me down is my curse, and that hasn't bothered me for weeks! [feathers pop out from Eda's arms] Uh oh...

[Eda transforms into the Owl Beast as Luz gasps in horror.]

Luz: King!

King: Weh? [peeks into the room] AH!

Luz: Get the elixir! Now! 

[The Owl Beast raises its head. Cut to Eda gasping, now standing in a void. Her childhood bedroom materializes out of the gloom. Her younger self is sleeping.]

Eda: [sighs sadly]

[The door opens behind her, revealing a indistinct shadow. Eda looks at it.]

Eda: You know, I'm getting a little tired of this game. [approaches the shadow, trying to grab it] So, why don't you just show me your face?

[In the real world, Eda is now holding Luz's face as Luz holds an empty bottle of elixir to Eda's mouth.]

Eda: [muffled] Oh. [lets Luz's face go and takes bottle out of mouth] Whew! Oh, thanks for this! [stands, knocking over about a dozen other empty bottles] And those...

[Eda's scarf falls off, revealing that her gem is still half black.]

Luz: Hey, your gem! It's still dark!

Eda: Uh... [pulls her scarf back on to cover her gem] No, it's not! You're nuts!

Luz: [points finger] The curse has been getting worse and you've been hiding it!

Eda: Ugh... you're right. It's taking more elixir to turn me back and more magic to keep the curse from rearing its feathery head. 

Luz: What happens if you use your magic up? Do you... do you die?!

Eda: No! Jeez, you're morbid. I just kinda sorta, turn into the Owl Beast... forever. Ahhh, it's a fate much worse than death if you think about it. [laughs sarcastically]

Luz: No! No, I-I can't let that happen! I'll do something about it. I'll find a cure and then--

Eda: [puts her hand on Luz's shoulder] Hey, don't worry. I just have to limit my magic use a little. [makes Luz grin] Ah! There's the Luz I know!

Luz: [sadly pouts with puppy eyes at Eda]

Eda: Ugh. Go on. Do the parallel arm thing...

Luz: [immediately beams and hugs Eda]

King: [also hugs Eda] King demands huggies too!

Eda: Okay! [walks in a strained manner with Luz wrapped around her and King on her leg] It's... time... for... school! 

[Cut to the kitchen door, which Eda drops Luz out of.]

Eda: Have a good day!

Luz: Get rest! Drink lots of water! Stay out of the sun! Lift with your knees, not your--

[Eda slams the door.]

Eda: Ah, what a good kid! So considerate. She deserves something nice. [picks up cauldron of witch's wool] And I think I know what!

[Cut to Luz walking to school, talking to herself.]

Luz: Poor Eda. Enemies everywhere, even her own body. I wish I could help her.

[A distant scream grabs Luz's attention. She peeks through bushes to see Hooty, wrapped around beaten up guards, serving them tea. One of the guards is feebly trying to escape.]

Hooty: [to guards] The roughhousing was fun, but I like this part of our playdates even better!

[Luz stands and shudders, then runs to school. She passes a ringing compact mirror on a pile of dirt, out of which Lilith's arm bursts. She grabs the compact and opens it as she drags herself out, a bird nest on her head.]

Kikimora: [from screen] The Emperor demands your presence in the throne room. And there's a bird on your head.

[Lilith looks up, where there is in fact now a bird in the nest.]

Bird: Oooo... you're in trouble! 

[Lilith groans and closes the compact mirror. Cut to Hexside, where Principal Bump and various students are lined up for a flying ship. Luz walks up to Willow and Gus.]

Gus: Luz, you ready for the field trip of a lifetime to the one, the only, Emperor's Castle!

Luz: Right. I was actually gonna stay behind. I don't like the way they treat Eda.

Gus: [shoving a book in Luz's face] But you're gonna miss out on all the cool stuff!

Luz: Like what?

Willow: Like ancient relics! Look, it's the Plant Coven's Green Thumb Gauntlet! It can grow whatever you imagine.

[The book shows a picture of regular trees captioned "BEFORE." The camera pans to the "AFTER" section, where the tree tops now act as heads, they all have arms and abs, and one is holding an owl's nest.]

Luz: Mmm...

Gus: And the Oracle Sphere! [book shows a white sphere with a two-headed snake on it] It shows you which path will help you become your best self!

[Camera pans to the Healing Hat.]

Luz: [reading] "The Healing Hat. Made from the magic of the Savage Ages. It is said to cure the deadliest diseases... and heal any curse"?

Willow: Yeah! You can't miss this!

Principal Bump: All aboard students!

[Willow and Gus head for the ship, dropping the book. Luz looks at it.]

Luz: Mmm. [picks up book] You've done so much for me, Eda. Now I'm gonna do something for you.

[Cut to the flying ship headed for the Emperor's Castle. Students on board are cheering.]

Principal Bump: No roughhousing! Do not make me turn this carriage around!

[Cut to Luz's notebook. She has drawn the Healing Hat and written: "HEALING HAT HEIST 1. Sneak into castle! 2. Steal healing hat 3. Lift curse".]

Willow: Hey Luz!

Luz: Ah! [hides notepad] Um, what was that, Willow?

Willow: I was just saying we were getting close to the castle. [she and Luz look over the side of the ship] Emperor Belos built it as a symbol of unity. Before he came to power, folks were doing magic all wrong. He taught us that the only way to respect what the Titan gave us is through joining covens.

[Luz looks doubtful.]

Willow: It's a shame Amity couldn't make it. She would LOVE this trip.

[Cut to Amity's bedroom. She's lying in bed with her feet propped up on a pillow, her right one still in a cast. She looks at a poster on her wall of Lilith posing with a sword, the words "Join the Emperor's Coven TODAY!" written under her.]

Amity: Shut up.

[Cut back to the ship.]

Luz: So, Willow... would you say this Belos guy is like, powerful?

Willow: [chuckles] No offense to Eda, but the Emperor is the most skilled witch that's ever lived. He can even talk to the Titan.

[The ship lands in front of the castle. Towering doors open.]

Principal Bump: Now, the Emperor's assistant will be your tour guide. Please don't make me regret taking you here.

[Kikimora stands on a platform as a bridge extends to the ship.]

Class: Whoa! Look at that! [gasp] It's massive!

[The bridge retreats, bringing the students closer to Kikimora.]

Kikimora: Children of Hexside, Emperor Belos welcomes you to his castle. We're honored by visits from students. You'll soon be a part of the coven, some lucky few may even find their home here, in the mighty Emperor's Coven!

Class: She looked at me! Wow, some!

Kikimora: You... are the future of the Isles! My job is to teach you its past.

[They enter the castle. Guards flank either side of a hallway, saluting, as others walk on overpasses. The walls are covered in tapestries, murals, and statues.]

Class: Ooh. Whoa!

Kikimora: Today, the Isles are a place of peace and prosperity. But that wasn't always the case. [gestures to a mural of witches dancing around a fire] Up until 50 years ago, witches and demons practiced wild magic during what we called the Savage Ages. [leads the students away] Witches had access to corrupt knowledge, and that dishonored the Titan.

[Luz stops at a grate.]

Kikimora: That was, until our great Emperor ascended to the throne, and taught witches how to use magic properly. [gestures to a mural of Belos holding up a beam of light, witches below celebrating his power] Our next stop is the Emperor's personal collection of relics.

Willow: Oh! Luz, you'll like this. It's where- huh?

Luz: [struggling to open vent, notices Willow and Gus looking at her] Heh... Uh, love me a properly ventilated castle!

[Luz follows the rest of the group. Cut to a door opening.]

Kikimora: The Relic Room. These items are reminders of our great Emperor's overwhelming power. [passes the Oracle Sphere] From the curious and mighty.

Gus: Oooh.

Kikimora: [passes the Green Thumb Gauntlet] To the very handy.

Willow: Oh, I could grow such beautiful things with that.

Kikimora: [passes by the Healing Hat] And even, the most valuable.

[Luz stares at the Hat as Willow is admiring the Gauntlet.]

Kikimora: Come along, children.

[Willow goes to catch up. Luz starts walking towards the Healing Hat, but Gus runs up and drags her along.]

Gus: Let's go, Luz!

[Cut to a hallway.]

Kikimora: Here at the Emperor's Coven, we require members with sophistication, elegance, and grace.

[A door slams open. Lilith is standing there, leaves in her disheveled hair. She spits out feathers and vanishes her staff, then enters.]

Luz: [gasps, ducks around a corner]

Kikimora: Ahh! Make way for Miss Lilith Clawthorne, students.

Class: Oh, my gosh. The head of the coven! Wow!

Kikimora: Yes, and if I'm not mistaken, she's on here way to see the Emperor himself. Let's all wish her luck!

Class: Good luck Miss Lilith!

Lilith: [blushes, inhales] Thank you, students. Good luck with puberty.

Kikimora: This way, children.

[Most of the class follows Kikimora down the hall as Lilith enters a door. Luz looks after Lilith.]

Luz: Hmm.

[Cut to Lilith walking through the halls, Luz tailing her out of sight. The closer to the Emperor's room they get, the more pipes are visible snaking around the walls. Luz is nearly caught, but ducks behind a corner before Lilith turns around. When she continues on, Luz peeks. Lilith stops at a massive door to clean herself up before entering. Luz runs up and watches through the keyhole.]

[Inside is a massive throne room. A beating green heart, far larger than would belong in any current living creature, is hooked up to pipes above the golden throne, which is flanked with flaming braziers. Various guards are standing around the room, one with a mask resembling an owl standing directly behind the throne. Belos himself is sitting on the throne, his head in his hand. Lilith approaches the throne and kneels.]

Lilith: I am at your service, Emperor Belos.

Emperor Belos: [breathes heavily]

[A guard brings a palisman on a tray.]

Emperor Belos: Just a moment, Lilith.

[Emperor Belos takes the palisman. He sinks his finger guards into the palisman's neck, dragging a line and breaking its head off. Glowing green goop falls out of the palisman, which Emperor Belos pours into the eye holes of his mask. His eyes, unseen before, flash a glowing green.]

Emperor Belos: Ah, that's better.

[Luz gasps and pulls away from the door, covering her mouth. She whimpers and runs off.]

Emperor Belos: How's the hunt for the Owl Lady? I heard you attempted a raid this morning.

Lilith: Yes, but we were--

Emperor Belos: Unsuccessful? That was obvious enough. It's been over a month since you promised to bring me the Owl Lady. Well, where is she?

Lilith: If I just had more time, I--

Emperor Belos: I'm getting bored of your excuses, Lilith. Don't worry, I'll give you the time you need. Bring the Owl Lady to me by twilight. She'll join the Emperor's Coven and in return, I'll heal her little curse. But, if you fail... [nails dig into his throne, heart above the throne beats faster] you will be stripped of your rank and banished from my coven. You do know what happens to covenless witches, don't you?

[Lilith looks over at the same mural the students saw in the hall. Screams overlay the scene; the witches depicted aren't celebrating his power, they're begging for mercy. Lilith stands.]

Lilith: I-- I understand. I will not fail.

[Lilith turns and leaves. Cut to the Owl House, where Eda is knitting with the witch's wool and King is napping.]

Eda: [holds up cloak] Yeah! Something tells me Luz is gonna like having a cape.

King: [wakes up] Cape? I thought you were making cake!

Eda: You thought I was knitting a cake?

King: I, uh... anyway! If there's no cake, then I have to get to work! [runs off] Would you look at us two, being all generous to that kid.

[Crashing.]

King: You know what, when she first got here, I thought we were gonna eat her.

[A louder crash knocks a picture off the wall.]

King: But now I only think of that, like, sometimes.

Eda: Yeah, she's changed the feel of this house.

[Eda picks up the fallen picture: one of Luz shoveling purple and green tentacles in her mouth, a banner behind her reading "FINISH OR DIE!"]

Eda: Well, she always had a good heart, but was impatient and always bit off more than she could chew. But despite all that, I think she's finally growing up.

[Cut to the Emperor's Castle. Luz peeks out of a curtain to look through a window, watching the class leave.]

Luz: Please don't notice I'm gone, please don't notice I'm-- boarding the bus?

[Sure enough, Luz is on the bridge. She turns around and sticks out her tongue at the real Luz.]

Luz: Huh?

[Willow taps Luz's shoulder.]

Luz: Wah!

[Luz turns around to see Willow and Gus, Gus spinning three spell circles.]

Luz: Oh! Guys. I, uh....

Willow: [pulls out Luz's notepad] You were planning on taking the Healing Hat, weren't you?

Luz: [sighs] You got me. But you don't understand. Eda has this curse and it's zapping away her magic, and--

Willow: Luz, no matter what, you can't steal this hat.

Gus: [steps in front of Willow] But, you can borrow it!

Willow: Hey! I wanted to say that! We learned about Eda's curse from your notes. We're totally gonna help you.

Luz: [almost crying] Thanks, guys. I know exactly what we gotta do. It's time for a heist!

[Montage: Willow, Luz, and Gus sneak through the halls when they see a guard coming down the stairs. They duck behind a small bush, which Willow grows into the shape of a unicorn. The guard stops, nudges its horn, and continues on. The three run off; Another guard is standing in a hallway. The three notice them and come out of a door stacked together awkwardly under one uniform. Luz, at the front, waves, high-fives the guard, and fingerguns as they retreat. The guard is very confused; Luz looks at the vent from earlier. She draws out a fire glyph and melts the vent; they reach yet another hallway, where Gus illusions up a double of Kikimora to send a guard off. Once the guard leaves, the illusion Kikimora does the worm. Gus laughs, oblivious to Luz and Willow's confused looks.]

[Finally, the three enter the Relic Room.]

Luz: Healing Hat. Mmm! You're Eda's last hope. [grabs hat, which glows] I-I can feel it! I can feel the magic flowing!

Gus: Me too! [holding Oracle Sphere] Finally, I'm about to become my best self!

[Gus holds the Sphere up, and a purple-tinted double of him appears.]

Gus Copy: You're always your best self.

Gus: [tears up, then starts crying]

[Camera pans to Willow wearing the Green Thumb Gauntlet. She grows a large wooden arm, which flexes and then sinks back into the Gauntlet.]

Willow: Whoa! I just wanted to try it out. [returns Gauntlet; chuckles]

Luz: Now we can cure Eda and get this hat back before anyone knows it's gone. [laughs]

[The scene distorts and pulses.]

Emperor Belos: I will know.

[The scene returns to normal. Everyone is looking at the ceiling. Luz and Willow back up nervously.]

Luz: We need to go. Now.

[Barricades drop in front of the doors, locking them in.]

Luz and Gus: [gasp]

[Doors to the relic room get locked, barricading Luz, Willow, and Gus inside.]

Willow: Stand back!

[Willow grabs the Green Thumb Gauntlet and grows a massive buff tree. It extends its arms at one of the barricades.]

[Cut to a hallway, where Lilith is pacing in front of the stained glass mural of Belos.]

Lilith: Lilith, think! You've given your entire life to this coven, you can't lose it. What's Eda's weakness? She has no attachment, no friends. Think!

[Lilith punches the wall at the same time a loud crash happens. She stares at her hand. Cut to the Relic Room, where the barricade now has a hole in it.]

Luz: [coughs]

[Willow's tree shrinks to nothing.]

Luz: Come on, let's go! [gasps]

[Luz stops at Lilith's pointed staff. Using her palisman, Lilith pushes down the hood of Luz's cowl.]

Lilith: Why, if it isn't Eda's human pet. How perfect.

[Luz backs up as Lilith advances on her.]

Lilith: Aren't I lucky to find you here.

Luz: Stay away! If you touch us, Eda will come after you so fast--

Lilith: [teleports in front of Luz] That's the plan.

Willow: Run, Luz!

[Willow raises the Green Thumb Gauntlet and grows a wooden arm to grab Lilith's staff. Luz runs. Lilith uses her staff to fling Willow toward the door.]

Gus: Wrong move, Lilith. It's two against one, and you don't stand a chance against--

[Lilith poofs Gus's copy, and throws him across the room with Willow.]

Lilith: Now, that doesn't belong to you. [magically grabs Healing Hat]

Luz: No!

[Luz tries to free the Hat from Lilith's magic. Lilith closes her fist, and the magic rips the hat in half. It disappears.]

Luz: No! I needed that to heal your sister!

Lilith: Huh. [grabs Luz] These decrepit relics are useless. If you wanna see your friend again, deliver this to Edalyn.

[Lilith throws her staff to Willow and Gus. The staff flies them away.]

Willow: Luz!

[Luz looks nervously at Lilith. Lilith smirks.]

[Cut to the Owl House, where Eda folds a completed witch's wool cloak.]

Hooty: [opens door] I spy with my little eye something coming this way!

Eda: Luz!

King: Wait! [pushes a cake into the living room] Wait for me! You're not the only one who knows dark magic! [holds up cake mix box] Now stop gawking and load me in!

[Eda stands and helps him in.]

King: Ow! Ow! Gentle!

[The shadow of Willow and Gus on Lilith's staff passes the window. They knock on the front door, which Eda opens. Her face falls when she sees it's not Luz.]

Willow: Eda, we have some bad news...

[Behind them, Lilith's staff is floating and glowing blue. Eda glares at it.]

[Cut to the bridge to the Emperor's Castle.]

Lilith: Come on, Edalyn. You would be late when I need you most.

[Lilith looks to the top of the castle, where Emperor Belos is watching. Yellow light flashes, and Eda appears. Lilith smirks. Eda throws Lilith's staff, which leaves a crater in the castle wall.]

Lilith: Sister! I see that you got my invitation to a Witch's Duel!

[Bolts of electricity fly at Lilith, though none hit her. Eda flies at her, taunting. Lilith blocks one hit with a summoned shield. She summons her staff and fires a bolt at Eda.]

Eda: Where is she? [flies at Lilith]

Lilith: Easy now.

[Eda stops.]

Lilith: The human is safe.

[Lilith taps her staff to the ground. A blue bubble flies out of the castle, with Luz inside of it.]

Luz: Eda!

Lilith: [walks in front of Luz] You can have her back, provided you do as I say. Renounce your wild ways and join the Emperor's Coven. He can help heal your curse!

Eda: Don't believe everything that bonehead tells you. He doesn't want to heal me, he wants to control me!

Lilith: Then I will take you in by force. [spins staff]

Eda: You've always looked down on me because I'm wild, but fortunately, that just made me work harder than you.

[Eda slams her staff on the ground, summoning a towering owl made of light behind her. She rushes at Lilith, launching her in the air. Inside the castle, guards turn to watch. In the air, Eda appears behind Lilith. Lilith disappears as Eda swings her staff. Lilith reappears behind Eda right as Eda disappears. Eda appears behind Lilith and kicks her, then zaps away to chase her. From the bubble, Luz watches Eda and Lilith zip across the sky, nothing but gold and blue lights weaving and crashing. Lilith shoots a beam of light at Luz's bubble, sending it flying. Eda lands on the bridge.]

Luz: [yells]

Eda: Luz!

[Eda redirects the boards of the bridge to keep Luz from falling off. Lilith drops down, and Eda rolls out of the way to prevent being crushed. Eda summons a Hooty Hydra to wrap Lilith up. Eda spins her staff and sends a giant blast at Lilith. Lilith puts Luz between her and the bolt, which Eda redirects, missing them both.]

Eda: [panting] Stop hiding behind Luz, you coward! [groans]

Lilith: [panting] It's sad to see you slowing down sister. Tell me, is it the curse?

[Eda growls, the sound half Owl Beast. The darkness in her gem grows.]

Luz: Eda! Your gem! [bangs on the bubble]

Eda: [ignores Luz] Maybe it is the curse. But then how pathetic are you, that you can't best me at my worst?!

[Eda spins her staff and summons a dozen rings of magic, all of which send bolts at Lilith. Eda's Hooty Hydra drags Luz to safety as Lilith summons a shield to protect herself. Luz looks around and notices a pointed rock.]

Luz: [gasp]

Lilith: Maybe you are stronger than me, but that made me work smarter! I became smart, crafty!

Eda: A lapdog for a tyrant!

[Luz hits her bubble against the rock until the bubble shatters.]

Lilith: You always thought you were better than me, that I could never beat you in anything.

Eda: I am better than you!

Lilith: Then why were you so easy to curse?! [gasp]

[Lilith covers her mouth. Eda looks betrayed.]

[A flashback to Eda's bedroom door opening. Light from the hallway lights up her sleeping figure. The mysterious figure steps forward, shadows disappearing. It was Lilith all along.]

[Back to the present.]

Luz: [gasps]

Lilith: A-And I have the power to remove it, if you would just let me explain.

[Eda looks away. She shakes in anger. With a yell of fury, she rushes forward and destroys Lilith's shield, flinging Lilith in the wall hard enough to leave a crater.]

Luz: Eda, stop! Your magic!

[The black in Eda's gem is writhing furiously. Eda doesn't seem to care. Lilith smirks. Luz is surrounded by glowing blue and starts floating.]

Luz: [gasps]

Lilith: Human. That orb was for your protection.

[Lilith moves Luz over the edge of the bridge. The magic drops. So does Luz.]

Luz: [screams]

Eda: Luz!

[Eda draws a shaky spell circle with her staff. Luz stops plummeting a foot above a score of giant spikes. Eda strains to keep Luz up.]

Luz: Eda, stop! You'll run out of magic!

Eda: It's my power, kid. And before you showed up, I spent my whole life wasting it.

[Lilith grins evilly. She summons a giant hand to push Luz closer to the spikes.]

Luz: Eda, no, no, no!

[Eda's gem is almost entirely black. The whites of her eyes begin to be taken over.]

Eda: Alright, kid. Listen to me. I'm going away, and I don't know if I can bounce back this time. Watch over King. Remember to feed Hooty.

Luz: Please, no!

Eda: And Luz, thank you for being in my life.

[With a scream, Eda unleashes a powerful burst of magic. Owlbert flies off the staff. Lilith is pushed back, her spell broken. Eda's magic illuminates the Isles. Luz, several feet higher than before, falls. She stops inches away from a spike, and Owlbert picks her up by the hood and flies her back to the bridge, where Eda is laying.]

Luz: Eda.

[Eda rolls over and screams, her voice overlapping with the Owl Beast's. She slams a hand to the bridge, and the Owl Beast stands. It advances on Luz, who backs away. The Owl Beast tries to pounce, and Luz cowers, but the impact never comes, Lilith binding the Owl Beast and dragging it halfway across the bridge with her staff.]

Lilith: Come along, sister. Now we can let the healing begin.

[Lilith looks up to Belos. He turns away.]

Luz: You monster!

[Luz jumps on Lilith's back and tries to drag her down. Lilith grabs her by the cowl and throws her.]

Lilith: Leave, human! [grabs Owlbert] Edalyn is finally with her family. Her real family.

[Lilith taps her staff on the bridge. Gears turn, pulling the bridge toward the castle.]

Lilith: Go back to your world. This one is ours.

[Luz stands and tries to chase after them, but can't. The doors to the castle close.]

[Cut to Luz slowly walking back to the Owl House. The sun is rising; she's been walking all night.]

Hooty: [yawns] Oh Luz, there you are!

Luz: Hi, Hooty.

[Luz opens the door to the dark living room. She looks at the side, her eyes widening.]

Luz: [gasps]

[There are balloons and streamers hung up. Party hats are on the couches, and confetti is on the floor. Her new cape is wrapped in a bow on the table, next to King's cake, the candles of which have long burned out. King bursts out of the cake.]

King: [gasps] The cake is me! [looks around] Hey, um, where's Eda?

Luz: [gasps]

[Luz's eyes fill with tears as she falls to the floor. Hooty looks at her in concern. Both him and King approach Luz to comfort her.]

To Be Continued...
