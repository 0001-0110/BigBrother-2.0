[Open on the Owl House living room, where Eda and Owlbert are playing a card game with Luz and King watching. Eda shuffles her hand, and the eyes on the cards look up at her. Owlbert, wearing a green visor, narrows his eyes and hoots.]

Eda: Watch closely, Luz. Hexes Hold'em is the most tricky game on the Boiling Isles. Any proper witch knows how to play.

Luz: Oh boy, cards! The paper rectangles that old people think are fun!

[Eda puts a card down on the table. Lightning comes from the cards, sending Owlbert flying for cover behind the side of the table. The cards all stand and roar. Owlbert's surge forward and attack Eda's, making Owlbert smirk.]

Eda: Now when it looks like the deck is stacked against you, that's when you break out the wildcard.

[She holds up a card with a tower on it. It glows green, and Owlbert's cards disappear in a flash of fire. Fiery letter spelling out "WINNER: EDA" appear and disappear over the table. Owlbert hops back on and hoots at Eda, his wings extended.]

Eda: Woo, I win! In your adorable owl face. Ah, I love the feeling of victory; it feels...fluffy? [feathers are growing from her arms]

Luz: Uh, Eda? It's happening again!

Eda: What's happening again?

King: Your curse is returning!

Eda: [yelps]

-THEME SONG-

[Cut to the inside of a chest as Eda opens it, Luz on one side and King on the other.]

Eda: Oh, boy.

[All of the bottles in the chest are empty.]

Eda: This is terrible. I'm out of elixir.

Luz: Uh, last time this happened, you turned into this thing. [holds up her phone, a picture of the Owl Beast on screen]

Eda: I know I should be repulsed, but that look is fierce.

Luz: Eda!

Eda: You're right, you're right. We need to head to the market.

Luz: Market! [stands and starts to leave]

King: [follows her] I'm stealing everything that's not nailed down!

Eda: Before we go, would anyone like to play one more hand of Hexes Hold'em? [pats her pocket] Hey, where are my cards?

Luz: [handing the deck to Owlbert] Take these and fly ahead. She'll have to follow us.

[He does.]

Eda: [running after him] Owlbert, you sore loser, gimme back my cards!

[Cut to the Bonesborough sky line as a winged demon flies past. Cut to the market, where Eda bangs on a metal grate.]

Eda: Hey, open up, Morton!

Morton: Uh, ju--...just a minute!

[King leaves Eda's side to sit next to Luz on a bench.]

Luz: Is there anything better than people watching in the Demon Realm?

[Three witches are standing at a bus stop as a giant egg rolls up to it. The egg cracks, revealing a featherless bird that screeches. It flies away. The witches enter the egg, one of them closes it, and it rolls off as Tiny Nose runs up.]

Tiny Nose: Wait, wait! Aw, dang it.

Luz: The curse of tiny legs.

King: I know the pain.

[Loud footsteps.]

Tiny Nose: [screams and runs]

[A witch waves his hand, and a cart with a large demon on it follows him. Luz walks up to Eda.]

Luz: Whoa, that is one ominous parade.

Eda: That's no parade. Those are demon hunters.

[The demon growls and bucks. The two demon hunters pushing the cart pull its ropes to pin it back down. It tries to bite at the first demon hunter.]

Eda: Dangerous nomads who capture and sell the most powerful beasts.

[The first demon hunter traces a spell circle, creating lightning in his hand. He grunts as he shocks the demon unconscious. He turns and looks at Luz.]

Luz: [gasps]

Eda: ...Which I'm about to become if you don't open up, Morton! [continues knocking on the grate]

Morton: [opens the grate] Sorry, Eda! I was up all night poison tasting and for some reason I don't feel great.

Eda: I'm all outta my juice, pal.

Morton: Oh, gee. Lemme see what I can do.

[Morton ducks down and digs around, rattling bottles. The demon hunters continue on, revealing Willow and Gus, looking dejected, behind the demon.]

Luz: Willow and Gus! [runs up to them] Heya, friends! Wait, what's wrong? Who hurt my babies?

Willow: Them.

[She points to a food stand. Skara and Cat are laughing while Amity is staring at a potion and Boscha is watching them.]

Willow: Amity's having a moonlight conjuring and invited everyone but me.

Gus: And she keeps posting about it on her Penstagram account.

[Gus summons his scroll, open to Amity's Penstagram post of her and her friends posing.]

Luz: "It's conjuring night! No dorks allowed"? What a jerk! [scowls for a second] What's a moonlight conjuring?

Willow: You spend the night at someone's house, telling stories, playing games...

Luz: Like a slumber party! We have those!

Willow: [pulls out a book] Then you bring something to life with moon magic!

Luz: [pauses] Like a weird slumber party!

Willow: Gus and I have never been to one. You need at least three people and--

Luz: I'm three people-- I mean, we're three people, and we're way better than them!

Boscha: [laughs as they all approach] Sorry you couldn't get an invite to the conjuring, Willow. [looks at Amity] Only real witches allowed.

Amity: [sighs] Leave her alone. It's not her fault she was born without talent.

[They all leave.]

Willow: [growls, grows several vines from the ground]

Luz: Whoa. [slaps the tallest vine, hugs Willow] Don't waste your time getting thorny over them. 'Cause we're gonna have our own moonlight conjuring.

Gus: Are you serious? This was on my bucket list. [pulls it out and checks it off] After owning a real human bucket!

Luz: That's a really weird thing to want, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'll go tell Eda.

[She runs to get Eda. Cut back to her and Morton.]

Morton: I've got bad news and good news. Bad news is I'm all out 'till next week. Good news is feathers are a good look for you.

[A feather grows out of her hair.]

Eda: Morton!

[That feather and several others flutter to the ground as she stalks forward.]

Morton: Well gee, E. Why'd you wait to re-up 'till now?

Eda: I've been very busy.

King: [from the bench] Yeah, busy playing Hexes Hold'em. She's obsessed with it.

Eda: I am not obsessed!

King: You're playing it right now!

[Several cards are now splayed out on the counter, and Eda has one in hand.]

Eda: ...Am I winning?

Morton: You know, I wouldn't suggest this to just anybody, but if you need your elixir you can try your luck later this evening.

Eda: In the night market?

Morton: There's a guy with a stand, goes by Grimm Hammer; if anyone has what you need, it's him.

Luz: Eda, Gus and Willow and I are gonna do a moonlight conjuring and stick it to Amity. So can we--

Eda: [grabs her staff and starts walking] Not tonight, I'm going out. I need you to watch the house, I have many precious objects in there.

King: Like me! Whoa!

Eda: [picks King up by his collar] You're coming with me. I need an extra pair of eyes looking out for pickpockets, and an extra pair of hands in case I want to pickpocket.

Eda and King: Pickpocket!

Luz: Then, maybe they can come to the house and--

Eda: No! Besides, conjurings are dumb; sitting in a circle holding hands. Pft. It's like magic for babies. [walks away]

Luz: But--

[Willow and Gus run up.]

Willow: Luz! What did Eda say?

Luz: So...guys...

Gus: Oh, look! [points upwards] The moon is rising into place. And the celestial powers only align once a year.

Willow: Oh, I can't believe I finally have enough friends for a moonlight conjuring! Thank you, Luz! Did Eda say it was okay?

Luz: Uhm...yes. She said yes. We can do it at the Owl House. As long as we don't make a mess or touch anything and never bring up that we did it! [nervous laugh]

Gus: Yes!

Willow: Oh, you're the best!

Willow and Gus: [singsong] We're gonna do a conjuring! We're gonna do a conjuring! Conjuring! Conjuring!

[Luz looks at the moon nervously.]

[Cut to the Owl House that night, where crickets are chirping. Luz is sitting on the couch watching Eda.]

Eda: Luz, you're in charge while I'm out. [puts cloak on] Make sure Hooty doesn't get into any trouble.

Hooty: [muffled] Hoot hoot! [opens door] I don't need a babysitter. I'm a big boy house!

Luz: You can count on me; I'd never betray your hard-earned trust. [nervous laugh]

Eda: You're acting suspicious. You're doing that thing where you hide in your hoodie.

Luz: [now has her hood up and closed] Meow I'm not. Uh... [pushes hood down] Oh, where's King?

Eda: He's right here.

[She opens her cloak to reveal King, snoring, strapped in a pink baby carrier.]

Eda: His little body just conks out when he's weightless. Look at this.

[She moves side to side, King not waking as he moves like a ragdoll.]

Luz: Aww, he's so dangly. [plays with his feet]

Eda: [walks outside] Anyway, really going now. And Luz...

[Luz grows nervous.]

Eda: [menacing tone] ...if you mess up the house, I will never trust you again. [lighter tone] No pressure! Bye!

[Owlbert hoots as Eda flies away. Luz waves after them for a few seconds.]

Luz: Ay. Should I really be doing this? No, no, Willow is counting on you. [whispering] Okay, she's gone.

Willow: Release!

[Two bushes glow and explode, revealing Willow and Gus in their casual clothes.]

Willow: I'm a sneaky sneakster!

Gus: I've got leaves in my pants...and I like it.

[Luz leads them inside.]

Hooty: Company! Hooray! Finally someone to listen to my stories! Okay, one time, a sparrow flew into my mouth, and then I--

[Door shuts.]

Hooty: Hey...

[He coughs out a sparrow, which flies away chirping. Cut to inside.]

Luz: Welcome to, the living room. We call it that because it's technically living! The walls are breathing, look.

[A wall is moving with heavy breaths. Willow looks at it closer.]

Willow: Enchanting.

Gus: [rummaging through a chest] And look at all these human treasures. [pulls out a skull] And actual humans!

Luz: We've got snacks, we've got weird music!

[She puts the needle down on a gramophone, which produces an evil cackle. Gus walks up to her with a bucket on his head.]

Gus: We've got a bucket!

Luz: Gus, my man.

Willow: And best of all we have actual friends to do the conjuring with! This is so exciting!

Luz: So how does this conjuring stuff work?

Willow: Well first, we find something to animate. Since it's our first time we should pick something meaningful. [walks over to some flowers] Something beautiful.

Gus: [bursts through the flowers with an action figure] Like this strangely buff little man? [taps the figure's stomach]

Beefy Bob: I'm half beef, half Bob!

Luz: Yes! He's perfect!

Willow: That's not exactly what I meant by "beautiful".

[Gus lowers the action figure, whimpering and looking hurt.]

Willow: Okay, buff boy it is.

Luz: Yes! [hugs Willow]

Gus: Tonight he shall be risen!

[Cut to the moon rising in the sky. Gus places Beefy Bob on the ground between the three of them. There are several lit candles around them.]

Willow: According to the conjuring books I've read, we say the incantation and make a connection with the doll.

[They all hold hands.]

Gus: Figurine.

Willow and Gus: Moonlight, we call, we sing. Moonlight take this chance. Moonlight come tie the string. Moonlight start the dance!

Luz: Moonlight tie... string... and I don't know the words!

[The moon continues rising. Hooty looks up at it. The moon stops moving, and a burst of blue light comes out of it. A similar burst of blue light bursts out from between Willow, Luz, and Gus, spreading around the living room and extinguishing the candles. They all open one eye and look at Beefy Bob.]

Gus: That's your cue, little man.

[The entire house rumbles. Hooty blinks, his eyes turning the same blue.]

Hooty: [ghostly noises]

[Birds fly away from the house while cawing. The foundation cracks as the Owl House rises. The three kids scream as they loose their balance. The Owl House stops rising, now standing on giant bird legs. Cut to the living room, now in great disarray.]

Luz: Guys? [a book falls on her head] Did the entire house just hiccup?

Gus: Little buff guy, what did you do?

Beefy Bob: A real man never takes accountability!

Willow: No, I think-- I think we might've animated the house by accident!

Luz: The house?

Hooty: [ghostly noises]

[Luz runs outside and nearly falls off the ledge. Gus and Willow join her outside as the House begins to walk. They all scream. The door slams shut.]

Luz: [running up to the door] Hooty? Hooty! Hooty, you have to stop!

Hooty: By the power of moonlight, I have risen. Hoot hoot.

Gus: He's in some kind of trance!

[The House steps through two trees. The jostling makes Gus yell as he and Luz lose their balance. He nearly falls off, but Luz and Willow catch him.]

Willow and Luz: Gus!

Willow: Our magic must've spread through the house instead of the doll!

Gus: Figurine!

[Luz and Willow grunt as they try to not drop Gus. They both nearly fall and grab the other's hand for balance. The glow returns.]

Luz: Hooty, stop!

[The House stops moments before it would have walked off a cliff. Luz and Willow pull Gus back up to safety and they all let go of each other, staring at their hands.]

Gus: How'd we do that?

[They all look at the moon.]

Luz: Willow, Gus, hold hands again.

[They do, glowing once again. The Owl House takes several steps away from the cliff.]

Willow: We're controlling it with the power of friendship. Uh, and the moon. Probably the moon.

Gus: This is amazing! What do we do now?

[The glow fades.]

Luz: On the one hand, we should probably stay put.

Gus: On the other hand, we've got a giant walking house and should totally take it on a joyride!

[Luz looks at the now-descending moon.]

Luz: Okay, okay, but we gotta be back before the moon sets or Eda will kill me.

[Cut to them directing the house forward, cheering.]

Gus and Luz: Yeah! Joyride!

Demon Hunter #1: [growls]

[Cut to a sign that reads "NIGHT MARKET," behind a pair of pikes with skulls on them. Every stand at the market is bathed in red light. Eda walks through the center passage of the market before stopping.]

Eda: [sighs, covers the feathers that grew] The curse. I need that elixir. Quick. [sees a demon sitting next to a crate] Hey, you. You know where I can find a Grimm Hammer?

[The demon nods with a grunt. A smaller lizard-like creature pops out of its eye socket and points to a foreboding stand. Eda approaches it. The demon eats the lizard. Cut to the Owl House, still walking through the forest. Boscha walks past with a crow phone and a duffel bag.]

Willow: Hey, is that...

Gus: It's Boscha. That girl who made fun of us.

Boscha: [to the crow] Ugh! Yes, Mom. I'm going to a moonlight conjuring. No, Mom. You can't come. And yes, Mom, it's sad that you're asking.

[She lets go of the crow, which caws as it flies away. She turns around and sees the Owl House.]

Willow: She noticed us. What do we do?

Luz: Hmm. [to Boscha through a megaphone] Hey. H‐Hey you. You should, uh, stop being so mean to people. You're kind of a jerk.

[All laugh.]

Boscha: Ew. A talking house is giving me a lecture? Whatever. I'll just TP you like I did with the rest of the neighborhood.

Luz: But don't you see? I am no mere house.

[The House stands as Luz roars. Boscha screams and runs away. The other three laugh.]

Gus: I've never pranked anyone before. And now I have a taste for it.

Willow: We should follow her to Amity's house to show off our conjuring. That will show her who's got no talent.

[Luz looks at the moon, which is nearly at the treetops and still going down.]

Luz: Actually, I'm starting to think we should head back.

Gus: Amity's updating her Penstagram.

Luz: "Shout out to my fellow witches. #Humans can bite it." [gasps] Let's do it.

[The House continues walking as they all cheer. Several shadowed figures fly after them. Cut to Eda approaching the stand and peeking through its curtain.]

Eda: Hello? Uh, I seek the one they call Grimm Hammer.

Tibbles: [ominously] I'm the one they call Grimm Hammer.

[The curtains raise. A pig demon jumps onto the counter.]

Tibbles: [normal voice] Welcome, welcome, welcome. I've got weaponry from the Hinterlands, curses from the Winterlands, and jelly beans.

[He tosses the jelly beans like confetti. King reaches for them and catches one.]

King: Jelly beans!

Tibbles: They're lethally delicious.

[King opens his mouth to eat it anyway. Eda knocks it out of his hand.]

Eda: You are Grimm Hammer?

Tibbles: Tibblet‐Tibblie Grimm Hammer the third. Please, call me Tibbles.

King: [laughs] He wants to be called that.

Eda: Okay, Tibbles. I need some of this elixir. [hands him an empty bottle]

Tibbles: Oh. This is one wicked brew. Lucky for you, [grabs one with his tail] I just stocked up.

Eda: Huzzam! I'll give you ten snails.

Tibbles: Add two more zeros and it's a deal.

Eda: A thousand snails? What kind of game are you playing?

Tibbles: Capitalism. Where everyone wins, [goes further into his stand] except you.

Eda: Hey! [notices a deck of cards] Say, you play Hexes Hold'em?

King: Really? Now?

Tibbles: Oh! Is that what that game is called? [chuckles and returns to the counter] I was just using these as coasters.

Eda: How about we make it interesting? I win, you give me the elixir. You win, you can take something of mine.

Tibbles: Oh, what fun. You're on.

[Eda smirks. Cut to Bonesborough, through which the Owl House walks. People on the streets scream and run for cover. Cut to a large manor with a gate reading "BLIGHT MANOR" in front of it.]

Willow: Look, Amity's house. Time to show Amity what a real conjuring looks like.

[The House starts forward, but is stopped by a giant rope over the roof.]

All: Wha‐‐

Willow: What happened?

Luz: Is that a... giant crossbow?

[Demon Hunter #1 gives the signal for the crossbow to be shot. A second giant bolt and rope secure the house further. Demon Hunter #1 jumps up in front of the kids.]

Demon Hunter #1: Knock, knock.

[All gasp.]

[Cut to the Owl House tied down a large cart being pushed through the woods by demon hunters. One stands atop a cliff and blows into a horn. Cut to the front door, Hooty making strange noises as Luz, tied to Willow and Gus inside, kicks at it.]

Luz: Hooty! Hooty! You have to wake up!

Hooty: If you want this to end as you say, three must hold hands. It's the only way.

Luz: ¡Oye, no me hable así! Willow, will you help me out with Hooty?

Willow: I'm sorry, Luz. You shouldn't ask me to help with anything.

Luz: Willow.

[All scream and grunt as the House stops moving.]

Luz: Did the house stop moving?

Gus: Uh, my insides didn't.

[The door squeaks open, making the three of them whimper.]

Demon Hunter #1: [laughing]

[Cut to the demon hunter shoving the three of them out of the Owl House.]

All: Ow! Ow! Ow! [all scream, grunt]

Demon Hunter #1: Take the house and rip out the house demon. We can sell it to restaurants as exotic meat.

Luz: No! Hooty would taste terrible.

Hooty: Hey, I'm a refined taste. Hoot! Hoot!

Demon Hunter #3: What do we do with the worms?

[Luz looks at her friends.]

Demon Hunter #1: Throw them over the cliff.

Demon Hunter #3: [chuckles as he approaches them]

Gus: [whimpers]

Demon Hunter #3: All righty, kids. Here's the end of your short little lives.

[He shoves them to the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea.]

Gus: [groans] Wait! Wait! Wait! [turns the group so he's facing the demon hunter] Is this really what you wanna be doing with your life? Tossing kids from cliffs?

Demon Hunter #3: Actually, yes. It's been my dream since I was a boy.

[The three of them look at him for a long moment.]

Demon Hunter #3: I was a strange child. Whee! [shoves them and laughs]

[All scream.]

[Cut to the three of them dangling from a branch sticking out of the cliffside.]

Luz: If we're not killed now, we will be when Eda finds out about the house.

Willow: Luz, I'm so sorry. You wanted to turn back but I just had to show off to Amity. The truth is she and I used to be friends.

Luz: Whaaat?

[The branch cracks.]

Willow: We played together as kids, but when she got her magical powers and I didn't, she stopped hanging out with me.

Gus: Guys, is now the best time?

Willow: [sighs] I just wanted to prove to her that I was a powerful witch, too.

Luz: That's ridiculous. You helped bring a house to life. Amity doesn't know what she's talking about.

[Willow smiles.]

Luz: Next to Eda, you're the most powerful witch I know. No offense, Gus.

Gus: No, not at all. I know what I'm about.

[The branch cracks and they all yelp.]

Gus: This tree can't hold us much longer.

Willow: [grunts as she frees a hand] There. Now, if I could just reach that root. Gotcha!

[Her hand glows green as she grabs it. Cut to the Night Market, and a flaming pile of Hexes Hold'em cards.]

King: Oof. That was painful to watch.

Eda: You card shark. You hustled me.

Tibbles: [chuckles] Looks like you forgot about my wild card.

[His wild card hops out of his hand onto the counter.]

Card: [growls and rips shirt] Yeah!

Tibbles: In any case, I'd like my prize now. And I choose... the little bone boy. [chuckles and takes King] I've always wanted a tiny servant to model my line of baby clothes.

King: No! I don't look good in clothes. I'm all‐natural. Eda, do something!

[Eda twirls her finger, but no magic comes out of it. Her arm erupts in feathers.]

Eda: [grunts] I can't perform magic.

[Tibbles snaps his fingers, and magic chains burst out of the ground to wrap around Eda. She falls to the ground.]

Eda: You think this can stop me? I can still bite your ankles.

Tibbles: You don't think I know who you are? Eda, the Owl Lady.

Eda: [gasps]

Tibbles: That's right. [pulls out her wanted poster] I've seen your wanted posters around here. I wonder how much the Emperor's Coven would pay me to hand you over?

[Eda glares at him. Cut to the cliff with the Owl House.]

Demon Hunter #3: Yeah, they tried to fight back and they nearly got me. But you know, I handled it.

Demon Hunter #1: They were children, Tom.

[A shadow falls over them. Willow has made the small root grow into a huge plant, and she, Luz, and Gus are standing atop a leaf. She moves one of the thorny vines to cut the rope and free them.]

Willow: We may be children, but we're also witches. Powerful ones.

[She sets the plant to attack. It flings Tom into the distance. Demon Hunter #1 pulls a sword and slices off the tip of one of the vines. A three-eyed witch tries to hit a vine with an axe, but misses. The vine grabs their ankle and flings them into a pile of rubble. Willow, Luz, and Gus run to the House while the plant is busy with the other demon hunters. Luz holds open the door for them, then closes it behind her.]

Luz: Everyone, quick!

[They join hands. Cut to Demon Hunter #1 cutting through a vine with a shock spell. As he does, the Owl House stands.]

Demon Hunter #1: [lifting his eyepatch] Uh...

[The House steps forward, crushing him. Cut to the moon, now on the water.]

Luz: Oh, no. I don't mean to step on this victory but we gotta get home before Eda does.

[The Owl House walks away, leaving the ruins of the battle behind.]

Demon Hunter #1: [groaning]

Demon Hunter #3: "They're just children, Tom."

[Cut to the Night Market, where Eda is still chained up on the ground, and King is sulking in a sailor's outfit.]

Eda: King, I'm sorry.

King: King? Who's King? I go by Little Bone Boy now.

Eda: I know I have a problem. I get obsessed with Hexes Hold'em. But I'm done with that stupid game. Look. [eats a card]

King: You promise?

Eda: [muffled] I promise.

King: [chuckles] Okay, okay. [kicks off the ankle chain] I'll grab you the elixir and then we can bust out of here.

Tibbles: Bone boy!

King: Heh?

Tibbles: You will do no such thing. The Emperor's Coven is already on its way to send this witch here to the Conformatorium. [holds up an outfit] And I just rustled up some more clothes for you to try on. [chuckles]

King: [throws hat on counter] Just because I have a model's body doesn't mean you can use me like this.

[Loud footsteps make a candleflame waver.]

Tibbles: [climbing onto the counter] I can and I am, bone boy. I've got the cards stacked against you.

[Loud footsteps.]

Tibbles: And nothing can stop me. Nothing!

[One of the Owl House's feet steps directly through Tibbles's stand. A bottle of Eda's elixir falls on the ground, intact.]

Luz: [waving out the window] Sorry, mister.

[The House continues down the street. Eda sits up and laughs. King backs away from Tibbles.]

Eda: Wait, what‐‐ Was that my house?

King: Eda, quick!

[He tosses her the elixir. She catches it in her mouth and downs it, then spits the bottle out. She traces a spell circle that makes the chains explode, and her feathers poof off her arms.]

Tibbles: No, no, no! My scam stand.

Eda: Sorry, Tibbles, old boy. It looks like you forgot about the wild card.

[She grabs her staff and throws cards at Tibbles. Her and King leave.]

Tibbles: Curse you, witch. Curse you, bone boy. I'll have my revenge. Tibblet‐Tibblie Grimm Hammer the third will have his revenge.

[Tibbles's stand falls apart. Cut to the usual location of the Owl House as it sits down in the crater it left. Cut to the living room, where Luz opens one eye.]

Luz: Did we do it?

Hooty: [opens door] Is the room spinning or is it just me? [chuckles] Ah. Just a little house humor. Ooh.

Luz: Sorry about all that, Hooty.

Hooty: It's okay. I'm just glad I was included.

[The door is slammed closed, revealing Eda and King on the other side.]

Luz: Oh, boy.

Eda: You are so busted.

Luz: Oh, man.

Eda: You held a moonlight conjuring.

Luz: I did.

Eda: And you animated my house. My house!

Luz: Yes.

Willow: [stepping in front of Luz] No. Don't punish Luz. We're the ones who pushed her to do the conjuring.

Gus: [stepping in front of Willow] If you're gonna eat me just do it now. Do it now!

[Eda looks disgusted at the idea.]

Luz: [to Willow] Hey, you didn't have to do that.

Willow: Yes, Luz. I did.

Eda: Well, you're all guilty, so you'll all be punished by cleaning my house top to bottom.

[She summons various cleaning supplies that land in the kids' arms.]

Eda: And another thing...

[All gulp.]

Eda: That was totally amazing. And I'm so joining you for next year's conjuring. Now get to work.

[The three of them run off. Eda flops onto the couch.]

King: I can't believe they animated a whole house.

Eda: Yeah. You're right. That takes some powerful magic.

Luz: [to Willow] You know, I still kinda wish we got to show up Amity.

Willow: Yeah. Too bad no one will know of our daring adventures.

[Cut to Amity's bedroom, where a stuffed rabbit is sitting on the floor. Boscha, Cat, Skara, and Amelia are all glaring at it.]

Boscha: Ugh. So what if we couldn't move a doll. Now we have time for what really matters. Penstagram.

[She summons her scroll. The other three summon theirs a few seconds after. Cut to Amity brooding, looking out of her window. Boscha gasps, getting her attention. She walks over and looks at Boscha's scroll. Her Penstagram feed has several people's posts showing off Willow, Luz, Gus, and the animated Owl House. Amity and Boscha share a look.]

Amity and Boscha: WHAT??

[Crows cawing.]
