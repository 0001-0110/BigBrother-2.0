[Open on Boscha with her hair down in her bedroom, which is filled with various trophies. She looks into her mirror.]
Boscha: You are talented. You are a star. You may be hated, so long as you are feared.
[As she speaks, she puts her hair into the usual bun then stands up, putting on a varsity jacket before heading for the door.]
Boscha: Most important of all, you are a winner.
[Boscha rips off a page of her calendar before walking out the door, revealing the whole month has been marked “Grudgby Season”. Cut to Boscha walking through Bonesborough dribbling a grudgby ball, passing several mesmerized onlookers.] 
Old Woman: There she goes, captain of the Banshees. Off to win another championship for Hexside.
Mother: [to her child] Why can’t you be more like her?
Child: [Breathes in deeply with an annoyed expression]
[Boscha approaches Hexside, with a banner reading “Go get ‘em, Banshees” magically unfurling over the school. Skara, Amelia, and Cat form up behind Boscha.]
Boscha: Alright, girls. You know the drill. Captain goes first. [enters the school] Hello, Hexside! Your star has arrived. Groveling line starts here. [looks around] Something’s not right. Nobody’s here!
Students: [Laughing from a distance]
[Boscha peers around a corner, spotting a crowd of students gathered around Willow, who is holding a potted plant.]
Hexside Student: No way!
Potions Student: Do me next. Do me! 
[Willow uses her magic, the plant sprouting a fruit looking like the potions student’s face. The student takes it.]
Potions Student: Welcome to the world, little buddy. You’re the coolest, Willow.
Willow: [blushing] Aw, shucks!
Bird Student: Yeah, Willow rules!
Boscha: [walking past with her posse] Wow, she has to make friends out of plants. How sad.
Amity: [entering] Oh, please! You know, I used to be like you, Boscha, obsessed with status, challenging my competition. But I grew up. When will you?
[The crowd of students laugh.]
Boscha: Oh, this is not gonna fly.
-THEME SONG-
[Cut to outside of Hexisde. Eda and Luz fly in on Eda's staff.] 
Luz: My first grudgby season! I’m so excited, I have more school spirit than the school spirits!
[Camera pans to a ghost holding pom-poms.]
Ghost: Why do I even bother? [groans and floats away]
Eda: Ah, grudgby season is the best. You know, I used to play, back in my gory days.
Luz: You mean “glory days”?
Eda: Well, that too. I was unstoppable on the field. I had the best moves and the best cheats.
Luz: Cheating isn’t anything to brag about. How do you know you were any good if all you did was cheat your way to victory?
Eda: Ugh. What do humans know, with your goody-goody attitude? If “cheaters never prosper,” why was I the star player?
Luz: Well, can’t reason with crazy. [pulls a sleeping King out of her hood] Bye King, you little snoozers.
[Luz kisses King's head and puts him on the staff as he wakes up. Luz leaves. King scurries into Eda's hair.]
King: Ugh. Eda, when was the last time you cleaned up in here? [He throws a bag of onion rings from Eda's hair, then pulls out a rat] Get your own scalp, buddy. This one’s taken. [throws the rat]
Eda: All this talk of grudgby has me feeling nostalgic. Whaddya say you and me take a little trip down memory lane?
King: Hard pass.
Eda: That’s the spirit.
Ghost: You mean me?
Eda: Ugh. Come on! [flies away]
Ghost: Oh.
[Cut to a history classroom within Hexside.]
Teacher: Over 50 years ago, Emperor Belos appointed a head witch to each coven. [Continues talking]
Luz: [to Gus and Willow] I can’t wait for grudgby season to start! I’ve studied up on all sorts of magical sports. Like this. [holds up a DVD case] Good Witch Azura 2: The Field of Deadly Fates. A classic underdog tale.
Willow: [taking the DVD case] Azura challenges Hecate in the smibbitch championship. But will she risk it all by taking a chance on the deadly Thorn Vault? [opens case]
Gus: [grabbing the DVD] Ooh, a shiny cookie. [tries to eat it]
Luz: [grabbing the DVD from Gus] Not food.
Teacher: The council headquarters was built and paid for by...? Anyone? Willow?
Willow: [stands up] Uh, the Pixie Dust Taxes?
Bird Student: [from the hall] Whoo, yeah! Go, Willow!
Teacher: Impressive, Miss Park.
[The students murmur in admiration.]
Luz: What’s going on? It’s like all of Hexside’s caught Willow fever!
Willow: Ever since I patched thing up with Amity, I’ve been feeling more confident. [gesturing to the flower shaped hair clip she's wearing] I guess it shows.
[The hair clip levitates off of Willow's head and into Boscha’s hand.] 
Boscha: Aw, Willow thinks she’s popular now. How cute.
Luz: Hey, I agree, my friend is very cute. But give that back!
[Luz grabs for the hair clip. Boscha pulls her hand back.]
Boscha: It’s weird that Amity hangs out with you now. Ever since Grom, she’s gone soft. But don’t worry. [puts clip in her hair] I’m still here to show you who’s boss.
Gus: [grabs the hair clip] Here, Willow.
[Gus puts the clip back in Willow's hair.]
Boscha: Oh-ho-ho! The friends wanna get in on this too, huh?
[Boscha levitates Willow’s bag into the air, spilling its contents onto Gus, Luz, and Willow.]
Boscha: [laughs]
Teacher: Is that laughter? Hey, hey! Learning’s not supposed to be fun!
Luz: We are having zero fun, I swear. Boscha’s picking on us.
Boscha: My apologies, sir. I was practicing my aim for grudgby. [throws an eraser at Willow]
Teacher: Boscha, how could you throw things at them... [draws a circle on his chest] when you could throw things at me? Am I over here? Or am I over here? Anything for the captain of the Banshees! 
Boscha: Oh, thanks, but I already have the perfect targets. [throws gum into Willow’s hair]
Willow: Oh! [groans]
Luz: Don’t worry, it’s not like she can follow us around all day, right?
[Cut to Hexside’s front steps. Gus, Luz, and Willow are covered in trash, their faces graffitied with insults.]
Luz: She followed us around all day. She literally followed us around all day!
Willow: [sighs] I’m really sorry I pulled you guys into this. We should have just kept a low profile. Boscha could get away with murder if she wanted to. 
Principal Bump: [going down the stairs] What’s this? Boscha got away with murder? I can’t say I approve, but at least she’s trying new things. [leaves]
Luz: We will find a way out of this. 
[Amity passes by the stairs.]
Luz: Amity! 
[Luz cleans herself off before running up to Amity.]
Amity: Oh, Luz! You’re here! I mean, obviously you’re here, this is school, and you go here now, with, uh, me... I’ve been talking for too long. 
Luz: Amity, we need your help.
Amity: Yes, I can help!... With what, exactly?
Luz: Boscha won’t stop picking on Willow, and no one will do anything about it because she’s the “Star Captain of the Grudgby Team.”
Amity: Yeah, this time of year, she’s extra unbearable. 
Luz: You’re friends with her, can you help us? 
Amity: Uh, the hard part is, there’s no reasoning with Boscha. She only speaks in grudgby terms. 
Luz: Hmm. Okay, okay. I’m pickin' up what you’re puttin' down. 
Amity: [looking at the books she's holding] I’m... not putting anything down. 
Willow: [screams]
[Trash falls on Willow from above as other students watch. Luz runs up to her.]
Luz: Willow! What happened?
Willow: Boscha happened.
Boscha: [from a second floor window, a trash can upside down in her hands] Hey Willow! I just thought all trash should stay in one spot. 
Luz: That’s it! Boscha! Willow challenges you to... a grudgby match! 
Boscha: [dropping the trash can] She what? 
Willow: I what?
[The trash can falls onto Gus.]
Gus: [from inside the trash can] She what? Seriously, what’s going on here? 
[Cut to the Owl House. Eda is in her old grudgby jacket, showing a photo album to King.]
Eda: And here’s when we took down Epiderm High in the semi-finals. [points to photo of her younger self holding a trophy] Oh, I was the youngest on the team, but I had what some call “star power”. AKA, this. [pulls a box out from her hair labeled “Eda’s Rad Cheats”] This is my cheat box. I have all my best weapons in here. Smoke bombs, sock-worms... Mwah. You name it. Oh, I never lost a game with this bad boy. 
[The door slams open. Hooty enters.]
Hooty: Hoot-hoot! Guess who found a special friend in the forest. [He brings in Lilith, wrapped up in his elongated body] It was me. Hoot!
[Hooty releases Lilith, who falls to the floor.]
Eda: Lilith. 
Lilith: Edalyn.
Hooty: [pops up between them] Hooty!
Eda: Ugh. Scram, Hooty.
Hooty: Okay!
[Hooty's body retracts back into the front door, which then promptly slams shut.]
Lilith: Why are you in your old uniform? 
Eda: No reason. It’s laundry day. What are you doing here?
Lilith: [summons scroll, clears throat, reads] Edalyn Clawthorne, you are hereby under arrest by the order of the Emperor of the Boiling Isles—
[Eda uses her magic to roll up the scroll, which smacks Lilith in the face.]
Lilith: Ah!
Eda: You were saying? 
Lilith: Come on! I have to bring you in. It’s time for you to join the coven. The Emperor has big plans for the Isles, and he wants you to be a part of it all.
Eda: [picks up the photo album; sarcastically] Ooh, Aah. What an incredible opportunity for me. 
Lilith: What are you even looking at? [grabs the photo album from Eda] grudgby pictures? Feeling sentimental?
Eda: Pah! Me? Never. I was just telling King here how good I was. [summons grudgby ball]
Lilith: Oh, Edalyn. Not only is the curse affecting your hair, but your memory as well. 
[Lilith holds up the picture of young Eda, unfolding it to reveal a young Lilith with an even larger grudgby trophy, and several medals.]
Eda: [groans] Ah, tell you what. I’ll go with you peacefully to the Emperor...
Lilith: Really?
Eda: Sure. If you beat me at a game of grudgby. Luz is always challenging people to things. Why not me?
Lilith: Hmm... Game on. 
[Cut back to Hexside.]
Willow: Luz, what are you doing? 
Luz: I’m just following Amity’s advice. Boscha only speaks in grudgby terms. Trust me, I have a plan. 
[Luz walks up to Boscha, who is exiting the building.]
Boscha: Okay, maybe it’s the altitude of the second floor, but I thought I heard you say that Leaf Girl wanted to challenge me to a grudgby match.
Luz: That’s right! We’ll settle this once and for all on the field.
[Students flank both of them. Willow runs up between them.]
Willow: Or we could just talk about our issues.
Boscha: Let’s do this.
Willow: Oh, no. 
Luz: If Willow’s team wins, you don’t get to pick on her anymore.
Boscha: Fine! And when we win, Willow and your team will be our water gofers.
Luz: Ha! That’s not even a punishment. I love water. 
Boscha: And we get to use you as target practice.
[Boscha throws the ball and kicks it, sending it straight through a tree trunk. The hole smokes.]
Boscha: See you after school, losers.
[The Banshees leave. The entire tree catches fire.]
Bird Student: Whoo-hoo! Willow verses Boscha!
Amity: Luz, this isn’t a good idea.
Willow: Yeah, I’ve never even played grudgby before! How am I supposed to beat Boscha? 
Luz: But you’re the better witch. I don’t know much about sports, but I know about sports movies. We, too, are a ragtag team of lovable misfits joined together to defeat a powerful enemy. With a little team spirit and a training montage, we can win. 
Willow: Well, if you think this’ll work, then I’m in. How about you, Gus?
Gus: In seasons past, [holds up a pair of flags] these flags have waved in support of grudgby greats. Now they will wave for the greatest: Me! [waves flags]
Luz: What about you, Amity? 
Amity: Me? On a team with you? Running around in cute uniforms? Sweating? [Amity blushes heavily, then runs off] I gotta go!
Luz: Huh? Well, I guess she’s out. In any case, let’s get training! 
[Cut to Luz, Willow, and Gus at the Hexside grudgby field.]
Luz: So, how exactly do we play grudgby? 
Gus: Well, [He summons a miniature illusion of the field to demonstrate] there’s a ball, and you score by getting the ball through the other team’s goal. [the illusion dissipates]
Luz: That sounds easy.
Willow: It is, except...
[Willow summons a leaf and blows it onto the field. The leaf is quickly ripped to shreds by fire, vines, ice shards, and rock spikes that emerge from the field.]
Luz: Oh, right. Boiling Isles. Should have predicted this. 
[Luz sets her phone to play motivational sports music. She puts a sweatband on.]
Luz: Alright! Every great sports story includes a training montage. 
Gus: [raises hand] What’s a “mon-tage”?
Luz: Well…
[Montage: Luz explains to Willow and Gus what a montage is using a chalkboard; Luz shows the two a football movie on a TV; the three of them have a tea party in animal onesies. Cut back to the grudgby field.]
Gus: Oh, I get it now. Wait, were we just having a tea party in animal jammies?
Luz: What happens in the montage stays in the montage! Now let’s hit the field.
[Luz blows a whistle, throwing a grudgby ball at Gus and Willow. It hits the ground. Willow prepares to kick it, but a giant tentacle burst from the ground, throwing the ball. Willow catches it.]
Willow and Gus: [yell]
[They both across the field and away from the tentacle. A giant hand bursts from the ground, grabbing Gus. Flaming grudgby balls follow Willow.]
Bird Student: [from the bleachers] Woo! Go Willow!
[Willow runs the opposite direction. A trampoline emerges from the ground and launches her backwards.]
Bird Student: You’ll get ‘em next time!
[Willow lands next to Luz, who hasn't moved at all.]
Willow: [sigh] I need a cup of water.
[Gus walks up to them and falls on the ground.]
Luz: Now for our big finale! Let’s try... [activates a plant glyph] the Thorn Vault. [puts glyph on ground]
Willow: Luz, wait-
[Willow and Gus are launched into the air by a column of thorns. Willow summons a large plant to break their fall. Gus rolls right off of it.]
Gus: [groans]
Willow: Gus! Talk to me, Gus! 
Gus: I, I think something’s broken. [pulls out his flags, now snapped, and gasps] My flags! I never should have tried to play. You were always enough for me. [sobs]
[Willow looks down to see her hair clip, now snapped in half.]
Willow: Come on, Gus. I have some floral tape in the greenhouse. We’ll fix them.
Gus: [sniffs] Okay.
[Willow and Gus stand and begin walking away.]
Luz: Guys, let’s try the Thorn Vault one more time. 
Willow: Not now, Luz. We’re tired.
Luz: But we’re the underdogs, we have to stay upbeat and keep trying and—
Willow: [walking up to Luz] Luz! Not everything can be solved with a good attitude and a dope music soundtrack. We’re going to lose. And no movie can help us against that. The game is off. [leaves]
Luz: Willow, wait! 
[Luz looks down at the broken hair clip. She picks.]
[Cut to outside the Owl House, with a makeshift grudgby field set up in front of it. Eda and Lilith approach each other from opposite sides. Hooty stretches out to be between them, now wearing a ref's hat and whistle.]
Hooty: You gals ready to hoot? We want a clean game here, so no magic allowed. 
King: [next to a scoreboard, dressed as a cheerleader] Yes! Now I’ll strike fear into my enemies with this armor of intimidation.
Eda: [laughs, snorts] Yeah, intimidation armor. [to Lilith] Pushing paper all day might make you a little rusty. I’ll try to go easy on you.
Lilith: Remember, dear sister, you may have been star player, but I was team captain for a reason.
Eda: [grunts]
[Hooty blows the whistle.]
[Cut back to the Hexside grudgby field, Luz sitting on the bleachers. She repairs Willow’s hair clip with a band-aid. Amity walks up to her.]
Amity: Tough practice? [sits down next to Luz]
Luz: I pushed Willow and Gus too hard. It’s just, I hate seeing Willow get picked on. She’s one of the best friends I’ve ever had. Winning this game is the only way I know how to help. 
Amity: Did you know, before Boscha, I was the grudgby team captain? 
Luz: Really?
Amity: Well, once I left the team, I decided that was a part of my life I wanted to forget. 
[Fade to a flashback of Amity as captain of the Banshees.]
Amity: [voiceover] We were playing Glandus High for the Island Championship. We had a move planned, and it was a good one. But, at the last minute, I decided I wanted to do something a bit flashier. I changed our game plan to... the Thorn Vault.
Luz: Good Witch Azura 2: Field of Deadly Fates! You watched it too?
Amity: Uh, yeah.
[In the flashback, Amity successfully does the Thorn Vault, launching herself to a goal post and tossing the ball in. The score changes for a Banshee win. Amity cheers, then realizes she hurt her teammates.]
Amity: It went disastrously wrong. My teammates got hurt. All because I had an idea of how things should be. I pushed them too far.
[Fade back to Amity in the present.]
Amity: I never played again after that day.
[Amity turns to Luz, their faces incredibly close. Amity stumbles back and falls, blushing heavily.]
Luz: Wah! Sorry. [helps Amity up] I just really love backstories.
[The Banshees enter, walking onto the field.]
Luz: [putting something in Amity’s hand] I know what to do to make this up to Willow. Thanks. [leaves]
[Amity looks at her hand, revealing Willow’s hair clip.]
Boscha: [to Luz] It’s after school. Where’s the leader of your loser brigade? 
Luz: I’m here on her behalf. We forfeit.
Amity: [gasps]
Luz: And I’m here to tell you that I’ll take Willow’s place as your water gofer, target practice, whatever you need. 
Boscha: Wow, you’re really a good friend. [magically lights a grudgby ball on fire] And a perfect target. 
Luz: [gasps]
Boscha: [throws ball at Luz] Think fast!
[Luz ducks out of the ball's path. Boscha summons more flaming grudgby balls. Luz runs as the balls are sent at her. Amity runs off.]
[Cut to the school greenhouse. Willow tapes up Gus’ flags.]
Willow: There, that ought to do it. 
Gus: These are flags of surrender now.
Amity: [slams open the door] Luz needs our help! I know she pushed you guys, and she always gets in over her head. She can be so stupid, which I love— I mean hate! In any case, she needs you right now, which is sweet— I mean, I hate it, and it’s dumb!
Gus: You lost me.
Amity: Just, here. 
[Amity gives Willow her hair clip. Willow smiles.]
Gus: Can we resist the call to action? No! May the flags be raised once more.
[Gus runs out, Willow and Amity right behind him.]
[Cut back to Eda and Lilith’s grudgby match. Eda tries scoring a goal, but Hooty blocks the ball.]
Hooty: Hoot!
Eda: Hooty! Whose side are you on?
Hooty: I’m an unbiased participant, hoot-hoot.
[Lilith grabs the ball, successfully avoids Eda and Hooty, and scores a goal. King marks the score, now tied 5-5.]
King: Point goes to Lilith. We’re at a tie here, folks.
[Eda and Lilith both pant in exhaustion.]
Hooty: Time for one more play. 
Eda: [pulls our her cheat box] Just one little trick and the game will be mine. 
[Eda opens her cheat box, only to find it empty, save for a note reading, “I noticed your lunchbox was getting dirty so I cleaned it! LOVE, LUZ”, with a drawing of a heart and Luz throwing a peace sign.]
Eda: Dang it, Luz! Your nonsense has gotten into my head. Well, time to do this the old-fashioned way.
Lilith: Taking your time. Nervous?
Eda: Not today, sister.
[Hooty blows the whistle, beginning play again. Eda and Lilith both jump for the ball. Eda grabs it and makes for the goal. Hooty emerges from the ground.]
Hooty: It’s me again!
[Eda steps on his face, using him as a launchpad.]
Hooty: Ow!
[Lilith leans on his face.]
Hooty: Oh geez, hey!
Lilith: No!
Eda: Yeah!
[Eda scores the goal.]
King: Ha ha! Game over! Team Owl House rules supreme!
Eda: Yes! Still got it! Still got the skills to pay the bills!
Lilith: No! [on her knees, slamming her fists angrily at the ground] No! I can’t go back to the Emperor empty-handed.
Eda: [sighs]
[Eda takes her ring off. She holds it out to Lilith.]
Eda: Here. Tell them I put up a heck of a struggle. 
Lilith: [takes the ring] I will be back for you. And next time, I won’t be alone. 
Eda: I’ll be waiting.
[Lilith looks over her shoulder at Eda, then walks into the distance.]
Hooty: I’ll be waiting too! Hoot-hooty-hoot!
[Cut back to the Hexside grudgby field. Luz is running from Boscha’s grudgby balls.]
Boscha: Having fun yet? ‘Cause I’m just getting warmed up.
[Boscha throws a flaming grudgby ball at Luz, which is sent back by a tree suddenly emerging from the field in front of Luz.]
Boscha: Huh?
Willow: Boscha. Your issue is with me, not Luz. Leave her be. 
Luz: Willow! [runs up to her] Willow, I’m sorry I got you into this mess. You’re right, I got my head too stuck in the movie biz.
Willow: It’s okay. I know you were just trying help in your Luz way. But now let’s finish this... my way. [turns to Boscha] The game is back on.
Boscha: You need three players on your team. Where’s your third?
[Willow and Luz look to Gus in the bleachers, looking sadly at his flags.]
Willow: Uh, well…
Amity: Right here. 
Boscha: You just destroyed your social life.
Amity: [looks at Willow and Luz] Nah. I think I made it better. 
Boscha: Ugh! Game on!
[Boscha stalks off. Amity, Luz, and Willow smile at each other. Cut to Boscha, Cat, and Amelia facing off against them, all six in grudgby gear.]
Gus: Go Willow!
Willow: [to Boscha] There’s something on your shoe.
Boscha: [scoffs] Like I’d fall for that.
[The ball is launched into the air. Boscha lunges for it but is stopped.]
Bosha: Huh?
[There are vines wrapped around her shoe. She falls over.]
Boscha: Oh!
[Willow catches the ball and makes the first goal.]
[The game progresses. Amity uses a giant abomination arm to hold back an axe for Luz, who scores another goal. Gus creates illusion duplicates of himself to cheer Luz, Amity, and Willow on. Amelia scores a goal for the Banshees]
Luz: Nice work.
Amelia: Thanks.
[The two high-five.]
Boscha: [annoyed] Hmm.
[The game progresses further. Boscha throws a flaming grudgby ball at Luz, who blocks with an ice glyph. Luz catches the ball, seeing a fire glyph burned onto it.]
Luz: Whoa.
[Luz puts a piece of paper onto the ball, burning the glyph onto the paper. She taps it, activating a fire spell.]
Luz: [gasps] Fire magic! [throws ball] Amity!
[Amity knocks it into the goal with a giant abomination fist.]
Amity: Yeah! [laughs happily]
[The score is now tied 9-9. Both teams huddle up.]
Amity: There’s time for one more play.
Willow: And this play could determine whether us underdogs win or lose. 
Luz: Here’s what I have to offer. [holds out fire, light, plant, and ice glyphs]
Willow: I think we should try... [points to plant glyph] this one. 
Luz: [gasps] The Thorn Vault? Are you sure? 
Willow: I’m ready this time. 
[Gus and his illusions cheer on as play resumes. The two teams face off at centerfield once again. The ball is launched into the air, and Luz catches it.]
Luz: Ha!
Amity: Watch out! 
[Amity pushes Luz out of the way of Boscha, getting tackled as a result.]
Luz: Amity!
Amity: Luz! 
[Luz activates the Thorn Vault, sending Willow across the field, and successfully scoring a goal]
Luz: Whoo! [hugs Willow] You did it, Willow! We did it! We Won! 
[Luz and Willow look to the score board, reading 9-10. Then the Banshees’ score changes to 999.]
Luz: Wait, what?
[Boscha holds up a golden insect.]
Willow: Oh, thorns.
Luz: Wh- What happened?
Willow: She caught the Rusty Smidge.
Luz: The what?
Boscha: Yeah, while you were celebrating your “victory,” I caught this guy. It means we automatically win. All magic sports are like this. 
Luz: That just invalidates all our efforts! If catching that thing is so important, why do anything else? There’s no reason to watch any of the other players! That’s such a stupid rule!
Boscha: Well, we beat them and proved our social dominance. All is right in the hierarchy. 
[Skara, Cat, and Amelia run up to Willow and Luz.]
Boscha: Hey!
Skara: Good game, Willow! 
Amelia: I had so much fun playing you guys.
Willow: Oh, really?
Cat: Willow, you’re really good. Would you want to be on our team? 
Willow: Mm, thanks for the offer, but I think I’m done with grudgby for a while. Hey, where’s...
[Amity groans, trying to stand up.]
Luz and Willow: Amity! [runs up to her]
Amity: I think— I think I hurt my leg. But, I’ll be okay. 
Luz: Are you sure? I could help carry you if it really hurts.
Amity: [blushing and chuckling nervously] I’m fine! Who’s Amity?
Luz: Aaaaand, scoop! [she picks Amity up]
Amity: [chuckling nervously] Oh, wow. Sports. 
Gus: Can we have another montage? 
Luz: Yeah! Montage, activate! 
[Montage: Gus, Luz, and Willow all score goals, then lounging in huge flowers with spring-like stems; Gus uses his illusion magic to change their team’s score of 10 to 1000; the three run up to the Owl House. King dances in his cheerleader outfit while Luz records on her phone.]
King: [chuckles] You’re— You’re not gonna show this to anyone, right?
Eda: Of course not. Keep cheering.
Luz: [chuckles]
[The montage ends with Amity, now with a cast on her leg, walking into the Owl House, with Hooty sitting her on the couch with Luz and Willow, surrounded by Gus, King, and Eda.]
