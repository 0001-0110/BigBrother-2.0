[Episode opens with King reading from a book focused on the history of the Boiling Isles.]
King: The Boiling Isles, born from the flesh and bones of a fallen Titan. This original magic was so potent, all life on the Isles evolved to wield magic too. For years, we explored those power freely. Until, a mysterious witch appeared who declared that he, and he alone, could speak to the island. He said that we were using magic all wrong. His teachings took hold, his strength grew, and he became... Emperor Belos. Belos said that mixing magic was wrong, that only he had that right. So he created the coven system. And there, our knowledge was restricted, and our potential sealed away. Those who resist are called wild witches, and they face harsh punishment. Emperor Belos has since retreated into his castle. There are whispers that say he's planning something big.
[Cut away from the book to King and Luz in the latter's room.]
King: I wonder if catching Eda was part of his big plan. What do you think, Luz? Luz?
[Luz stares at the tag on her cape, reading: 'To a young witch from her proud mentor EDA'.]
Luz: I don't care what Belos is up to... because today, I'm saving Eda!
[Cut to Luz opening the door to a room decorated with weapons.]
King: Luz, what are you doing?
Luz: This is serious, King. Eda used her power to save me and got caught by Lilith. Now she's the Owl Beast and is being taken before the Emperor! I don't know what he's planning to do with Eda, but I'm going to rescue her.
King: Haven't you been listening to me? He's the Emperor! He's the most powerful witch alive!
Luz: King, please try to understand. Eda is in this situation because of me. Because of my stupid choice. I have to make up for it.
King: But she's in her Owl Beast form! How will she even recognize you?
Luz: I don't know. But I have to try anyway.
King: Well then, I'm going too.
Luz: King...
King: Me and Eda don't always see eye to eye, but I do consider her family. I want her back as much as you do.
Luz: Alright. Then we've got no time to lose! [runs out of the room]
King: Nyeh!
[King throws the book on the ground, which opens to the page with Belos on it. Cut to Emperor Belos's throne room, focusing on the Titan's beating heart before panning down to the throne.]
Beast Eda: [runs around from Lilith]
Lilith: Eda, stop that this instant!
Beast Eda: [tears down a tapestry of Belos, begins chewing on it]
Lilith: [bubbles Beast Eda] Don't look at me like that. This is for your own good. Emperor Belos will heal you, and we'll be in his coven together. Isn't that wonderful?
Beast Eda: [blows a raspberry at Lilith]
Lilith: I will not fall prey to your childish games. [promptly sticks her tongue out at Eda]
[The door to the throne room opens. Six coven guards and Kikimora enter.]
Kikimora: All kneel before Emperor Belos!
[Kikimora bows and moves away from the door. Lilith kneels. A pair of glowing blue eyes approach from the darkness, eventually revealing Emperor Belos.]
Beast Eda: [shrieks and bursts out of the bubble, running towards Belos]
Lilith: Eda, no!
[Belos vanishes before Beast Eda can attack him, appearing behind her and throwing her against a wall by lifting his finger. Beast Eda falls to the ground, glowing red ropes appearing to keep her down.]
Lilith: [runs between Beast Eda and Belos's shadow] My Lord, I apologize for my sister's rash behavior. She is still in her cursed form. Once you've healed her, as promised, I am sure she will become a useful asset to the coven!
Emperor Belos: [summons his mechanical staff and raises it, healing Eda only to the point of allowing her speech in her Beast form]
Beast Eda: Ah. Where am I? What is this? Aw farts, I got caught.
Emperor Belos: Edalyn Clawthorne, the infamous Owl Lady, the wild witch of Bonesborough. Mentor of Luz the Human.
Beast Eda: You stay away from her, or so help me, Titan....
Emperor Belos: [chuckles] You've got it all wrong. The human is safe, for now. I just want the portal she came through.
Beast Eda: Tough, 'cause I ain't telling you nothing!
Emperor Belos: Ugh, pity. Although I suppose I could ask the human herself.
[Belos snaps his fingers, and the guards run in to drag Eda away.]
Beast Eda: Wait! Don't touch her! Lilith, don't let him hurt her! Lilith!
Lilith: Ah, taking her to the healing ceremony?
Emperor Belos: I will not be healing her.
Lilith: But, you, promised me.
Emperor Belos: Don't be so naïve, Lilith. This is the Titan's will. All wild witches must be dealt with with before the Day of Unity. You understand, don't you?
Lilith: Of course...
Emperor Belos: Good. [begins walking away] Oh, one more thing.
[Belos snaps his fingers, and Owlbert and the bottom half of Eda's staff appear in Lilith's hands.]
Emperor Belos: Destroy the Owl Lady's staff. She won't be needing it anymore.
[Belos leaves the throne room, leaving Lilith staring after him. The doors close. Cut to a news broadcast on a crystal ball.]
Perry Porter: Perry Porter coming to you live from outside the Emperor's Castle. Edalyn Clawthorne, known commonly as "Eda the Owl Lady," has been captured and has been brought before the Emperor.
Kikimora: For the crime of attacking a coven leader and refusing to join a coven, Edalyn Clawthorne's body shall be petrified in stone! Today, sundown, at the Conformatorium.
Gus: [gasps and turns to his scroll] Willow! Are you watching?
Willow: Yes. We have to do something.
Perry: Today is a grave day for Bonesborough.
[Various demons and witches watching the crystal balls in the street murmur in discussion and walk off, revealing Luz and King.]
Luz: Please tell me that's not as bad as it sounds.
King: Petrification is only done to the worst criminals, and once the spell is complete, it can't be reversed.
[The newscast shows several petrified witches in what looks like a graveyard before fading to a picture of Lilith.]
Luz: Lilith. She cursed Eda. She captured her own sister! She is the worst! If I ever see her again!
[Luz tosses the crystal ball displaying the news onto the ground, shattering it.]
King: Luz, calm down. We need to think about saving Eda first!
Luz: [sighs] You're right, but how will we get to the Conformatorium in time?
[A guard walks by, whistling. King narrows his eyes while looking at the guard.]
King; We'll have to do something so diabolical, so criminally insane, that they'll have to send us to the Conformatorium.
Luz: Hey!
Guard: Hm?
[Luz and King are standing on grass, directly in front of a DO NOT STEP ON GRASS sign.]
Luz and King: Whaaa?
Guard: [gasps]
Luz: Yep.
[Doors close, securing Luz and King in a paddy wagon.]
Luz: Perfect plan.
[Cut to the sign for the Conformatorium. The paddy wagon passes by petrified wild witches, which Luz and King stare at.]
Luz and King: [gasp]
[Two guards bring out a pedestal with Eda's name on it.]
King: There's not gonna be a new statue going up today. Right, Luz? Luz?
[The wagon passes a poster of Lilith.]
Luz: [growls]
[The paddy wagon continues on, entering the Conformatorium proper. A gate closes behind it, and the camera pans up to reveal a banner reading 'PETRIFICATION TODAY AT SUNDOWN'. Cut to inside, where the paddy wagon backs in to a docking station.]
Guard: Sir, the Owl Lady's human student has been apprehended.
Warden Wrath: Very good. Ah, Luz the Human. How I've waited to see you again. Now I'll have my revenge and you'll have front row seats to Eda's demise.
[Wrath opens the paddy wagon doors and is bombarded by branches.]
Warden Wrath: [screams]
Emperor's Coven Guard: Huh?
Luz: [screams and slams an ice glyph on the ground]
[A spear of ice pins the Emperor's Guard to the ceiling. Wrath shoves away the branches, then is captured by several ice pillars. Luz walks up to him with King on her shoulder.]
Luz: Where's Eda?
Warden Wrath: She's in the holding cell in the dungeon.
Luz: Draw me a map!
[Cut to outside, where an audience is gathered.]
Member 1: Do you really think Eda deserves a petrification?
Member 2: I don't know. This is all happening so fast.
Willow: If we know anything about Luz, she's going to be here trying to save Eda.
Gus: And we'll be here to save her when she needs us!
Willow: Let's split up and find her!
[Zoom out to see Lilith watching the crowd from a window.]
Kikimora: Fools! You let the human escape! And you drew her a map?
Lilith: Worry not, Kikimora. I shall capture the human.
[Cut to a hallway, where two guards are hanging in vines from the ceiling, another can only be seen by his legs, a fourth is holding his hands in front of a fire, and a fifth is encased in ice. Luz walks away from the scene, running to a padlocked set of double doors.]
Luz: King, watch the door.
King: Weh.
[Luz steps forward and places an ice glyph on the lock, freezing and breaking it. She enters the room and pulls out a light glyph.]
Beast Eda: [growling off screen]
Luz: Eda? Eda!
[Luz runs to her, but bounces off when her wing twitches. Beast Eda turns at the noise and growls, going in for the attack]
Luz: [pulls out an activated light glyph] Eda, wait! It's me! It's me.
Beast Eda: [closes her eyes, reopens them to reveal them being gold again] Luz? Oh no, oh no no no no no wh- what are you doing here?
Luz: It's okay Eda, I'm here to save you.
[She activates a fire glyph on the chain keeping Eda in place, but the flame does nothing.]
Beast Eda: Your magic isn't strong enough for this. You need to leave! Now.
Luz: But, but I can't! It's my fault you needed to save me. It's my fault you got captured.
Beast Eda: No. Listen to me. I'm here because of my own actions. I went against Belos's law, and for a while I was able to get away with it. But, [sighs] well without magic, I can't do much. I don't regret anything. I lived freely and... I got to meet you.
Luz: Eda...
Beast Eda: But if you stay here, I won't be able to protect you. You need to leave. Now!
Luz: But we're a family! Us weirdos have to stick together, remember?
[Eda sticks a claw into her hair, pulling out the key for the portal door. She activates it, making the door rise from the floor. It opens as she speaks, revealing the same path that Luz chased Owlbert down at the beginning of the summer.]
Beast Eda: You have a family already. Go back to them. And when you're home, use your fire magic to destroy the portal door. [places the key around Luz's neck] I don't know why Belos wants it, but we can't take any chances.
Luz: [looks at Eda with tears in her eyes before tucking the key under her cloak and hugging her] I love you, Eda.
Beast Eda: I love you too, kiddo.
[A siren blares as a door in the ceiling opens.]
Beast Eda: Luz, get away!
[Eda pushes Luz away as the chain around her neck glows blue and transforms into a cage. The ground beneath Eda begins to rise.]
Luz: No! [runs forward and grabs a hold of the bottom of Eda's claw] Not yet!
Beast Eda: I'm sorry. [pushes Luz off] Goodbye, Luz.
Luz: Eda!
[The platform completely rises into the ceiling with an air of finality. Luz cries into her hand, kneeling between the door to the human realm and where Eda had been just moments before. Cut to the door as it opens suddenly.]
Lilith: Drat!
King: Let me go!
Lilith: I'm too late, at least I found you, human.
Luz: You. You hurt Eda. You put her in chains. And now, I will take you down! [yells as she jumps at Lilith, activating spell cards]
Lilith: [drops King to block Luz's spell with her staff] I just wanna talk!
Luz: Talk to the glyph, witch!
[Luz slams five plant glyphs to the ground at once, summoning several tendrils to trap Lilith. She breaks through them easily with a spin of her staff, but Luz uses the distraction to jump onto Lilith.]
Lilith: Ah, stop! What is wrong with you?
[The two walk through the still-open portal door.]
King: Luz! [follows them through the door]
[Luz and Lilith fall off the porch of the house in the human realm. King follows through a second later. Luz is the first to recover, looking at the forest they landed in as the wind blows her cloak and hair. Lilith stands behind her with her hands glowing blue.]
King: Luz, watch out! [is pulled to the ground by vines]
Luz: [dives out of the way of Lilith's spell and pulls a fire glyph out] Fire! [the glyph disintegrates in her hands] What?
Lilith: [tackles Luz] Please, just listen to me!
Luz: No way! You deserve to be petrified! Not Eda!
Lilith: You're right. [backs away from Luz] I deserve to be in Edalyn's place.
Luz: Why did you do all this?
Lilith: When Edalyn and I were younger, we were, the best of friends.
[Cut to flashback of a young Lilith and Eda, wearing Potions-track Hexside uniforms, running through the woods while laughing. Young Eda trips, then sits up to reveal her knee bleeding. She starts crying. Young Lilith turns around and kneels in front of her, cupping Eda's face to wipe her tears before putting their foreheads together.]
Young Lilith: With this spell declared, let the pain be shared.
[Half of Eda's wound transfers to Lilith's knee. She winces, but both of them grin. Cut to a teenage Eda and Lilith practicing duels with a mop and a broom respectively.]
Lilith: [voiceover] Being in the Emperor's Coven was my dream. I wanted to work alongside the most powerful witch on the Isles and make the world a better place.
[Eda spins the mop easily, while Lilith whacks herself in the head with her broom.]
Lilith: [voiceover] Eda wanted to be with me, but there was a problem.
[Cut to the Hexside grudgby pitch, where a field day is being held. Teen Eda and Lilith are standing in front of the Emperor's Coven stand.]
Emperor's coven delegate: One spot is available. You duel tomorrow. The winner will join our ranks.
Lilith: [voiceover] I knew Edalyn would beat me. She was younger, but worked twice as hard. She met me at my level.
[Teen Lilith walks away from the stand while Eda reaches out to her. Cut to Teen Lilith wearing a cloak and walking through the Night Market.]
Lilith: [voiceover] Emperor Belos always said, "To be great, you have to make sacrifices." What would he do in my situation? I found a spell that would take away her powers.
[Teen Lilith looks at a scroll with an owl seal on it. Her face goes from nervous to determined, and breaks the seal. A bright red light comes from the scroll, taking over the screen. Cut to a door opening to Eda's room as she sleeps. An indistinct, shadowy figure becomes Lilith as she steps forward and pulls down the hood of her cloak. She approaches Eda's bed, holding out the cursed scroll. It glows red again, reflecting in Lilith's glasses ominously.]
Lilith: [voiceover] I thought it would just be for a day.
[Cut to the Hexside grudgby pitch again. This time the stands are packed, and Teen Eda and Lilith stand opposite each other. They each raise an arm in a dueling pose, before Lilith runs forward with a yell, a blue flame appearing in her hand. Eda watches her approach.]
Teen Eda: No!
[Teen Lilith skids to a halt, the flame on her hand dying out. She looks surprised.]
Teen Eda: I refuse to battle my sister. [walks up to a shell-shocked Lilith] I've decided that covens aren't really my style. Hey, don't forget me when you're a big shot, sis.
Lilith: [voiceover] And as Edalyn walked away...
[Teen Eda barely makes it to the edge of the grudgby pitch before she starts yelling in pain and falls to her hands and knees. Feathers burst from her hand and race up her arm, tearing the seam of her uniform. Brown wings sprout from her back, her ears grow as she covers her face with claws, until she screams in a voice part-witch and part-beast, her eyes pitch black. The newly transformed Owl Beast looks at the crowd, looks at Lilith, terrified.]
Crowd: [yells and jeers]
Crowd Member: What is that?!
Crowd Member 2: That girl is a monster!
[A rock hits Beast Eda's forehead. Emperor's Coven members continue to throw rocks at her as the crowd boos, until Beast Eda flares her wings and snarls at them.]
Crowd Member 3: Get out! GO!
[Beast Eda does just that, turning tail and running away.]
Teen Lilith: Edalyn!
Emperor Belos Delegate: [grabs Lilith's arm] Lilith Clawthrone, we welcome you to the Emperor's coven!
[He holds Teen Lilith's arm up in triumph as the crowd cheers.]
Lilith: [voiceover] I made my sacrifice for the emperor, and it was time to receive my reward.
[Cut to present day.]
Lilith: I've been pursuing Edalyn because if she joined the Emperor's coven, Emperor Belos told me he would heal her curse. But he lied to me. I know how to rescue Edalyn, but I can't do it alone.
Luz: How do I know I can trust you?
[Lilith appears to think for a second before tracing a large spell circle. Owlbert and the rest of Eda's staff appear in her hands. She holds them both out to Luz, who takes them.]
Luz: Owlbert! You're okay.
[Owlbert opens his eyes and coos, nuzzling into Luz. She puts him on her shoulder and uses the staff to stand.]
Luz: All right, Lilith. I don't like your whole, [she points at Lilith and traces a circle with her finger] deal, but... [her expression softens] we need your help to save Eda.
[Luz holds out the door key as Lilith stands.]
Lilith: Thank you.
[The vines around King loosen and let's him go.]
King: Weh?
Lilith: Now, lets head back.
[Lilith heads for the door. Luz starts to follow her, but a breeze makes her look back at the human realm behind them. A nostalgic, mournful tune plays as she stares at the trees. Lilith walks through the door, but King notices Luz lingering.]
King: Hey Luz, You...need a minute?
Luz: No. I'm coming.
[She walks up the steps as King follows Lilith. Luz pauses just before entering, taking one last look at the human realm, before disappearing in the glowing white. The glow disappears with her, leaving just a broken down house with a closed door.]
[Cut to an Emperor's Coven guard drumming a beat. Zoom out to reveal several drumming guards in two lines in front of a large crowd.]
Willow: I don't see Luz anywhere
Gus: Do you think she got caught?
[An alarm sounds, and the cage with Beast Eda in it rises onto a towering platform in front of the crowd.]
Perry Porter: Well folks, Eda the Owl Lady has appeared on stage, which means the petrification process is about to begin.
[Kikimora finishes rising with the cage. She walks forward and pushes a lever, making the three headed statue rise from the ground. Beast Eda visibly looks nervous as the machine crackles to power. Cut to the inside of the Conformatorium, where Lilith, Luz, and King are passing by towering statues covered in what appear to be meaty tendrils. They stop in front of a small platform.]
Lilith: You can take this up to the stage where they're holding Edalyn.
Luz: Thank you, Lilith. What will you do now?
Lilith: I will stay in the Emperor's coven, but I will make sure nothing like this ever happen again.
Luz: That's good to hear. [looks around] Wait, why are there no guards around?
[A red tendril wraps itself around Lilith's legs, pulling her down.]
Lilith: [screams]
Luz: Lilith!
King: [screams as he also gets taken by a tendril]
Luz: King!
[Lilith and King are dragged up near the ceiling before being suspended on either side of the far wall. Fires ignite below them, flanking a skull-like throne that Belos is sitting in, his staff in hand.]
Emperor Belos: Ah, Lilith. You chose the wrong side.
[Lilith and King are pulled upwards. Luz stares in horror and tries to walk forward, but two arms grab her legs.]
Luz: No!
Emperor Belos: Ah puh-puh. I'd actually like to have a word with you, human.
[Luz glares at Belos.]
[Cut to Lilith and King being forced into Beast Eda's cage by two Emperor's Coven members. They both land, kneeling, as the bars close behind them.]
Lilith: [looks up] Hello, Edalyn.
Beast Eda: [glares for several seconds] Lilith. [begins pacing] You hurt Luz. You cursed me. Before anything turns me to stone, I'll tear you apart. [raises her claw.]
King: [jumps between Eda and Lilith] No, don't!
Eda: [gasps]
King: She was trying to help. She even betrayed the Emperor for you!
Beast Eda: What?
Lilith: If I knew something like this would happen, Edalyn, I--
[Lilith tries to cup Eda's face, but the activation of the petrification machine earns both of their attentions. The machine's eyes begin to glow, first yellow, then green. Cut to the crowd.]
Willow and Gus: [gasp]
Willow: We gotta do something.
Perry Porter: And in a shocking turn of events, head Coven leader Lilith is now in the holding cage. Escorted by what appears to be a deranged cat.
[Gus pulls on his sleeve.]
Perry Porter: Augustus? I'm live!
Gus: Dad, you have to stop!
Willow: [grabs Perry's microphone] Yeah. What's happening to Eda isn't right. She might not always follow the rules, but she hasn't done anything worthy of a petrification!
Eye-Eating Prisoner: She helped me escape jail.
Morton: She helps me stay in business!
Principal Bump: She helped me love teaching again... after she left.
Willow: The Emperor should let Eda go.
Gus: Let Eda go!
Crowd: [chanting] Let Eda go! Let Eda go! Let Eda go! Let Eda go!
[Camera pans down to the chamber with Luz and Belos.]
Luz: Let my friends go, or else!
Owlbert: [hoot]
[Luz slams the butt of Eda's staff into the floor, rocketing out of the grip of the hands holding her down. She lands with a flip and slams the staff down, summoning a row of ice spikes that stops inches away from Belos's mask.]
Emperor Belos: Okay. [melts from the throne, reappearing behind Luz, appearing to be more liquid than solid mass] I'll play.
[Belos lifts a finger and flicks it, sending Luz into the base of a towering statue. A crack travels up the statue, until it frees the giant two-headed axe, which Luz just barely dodges.]
[Luz sends a fireblast at spikes of earth. She freezes a giant red hand in a block of ice. She mounts the staff to avoid more earth spikes. She pulls the staff around and aims for Belos, fire glyphs in hand.]
[Belos stands immobile as the intro monster appears around him.]
Luz: [screams]
[The intro monster swallows Luz. It explodes a second later, and Luz lands on the ground on her feet.]
Emperor Belos: [screen pulsing with his words] What's wrong, human? I thought you wanted to fight.
[The shadow of Belos passes, and Luz turns to face it. More arms grab her legs and arms, pulling her back down to the ground.]
Luz: Huh? Ah!
Emperor Belos: [appearing from the shadows] Had enough?
Luz: [smirks] Not even close. [moves her hand to reveal an ice glyph]
[The ice pillar hits Belos's mask, chipping a piece off. Luz looks at the shard before looking back up at Belos.]
Emperor Belos: [chuckles] I like your spirit. [turns around to reveal a glowing blue eye shining out of the broken half of his mask] But try that again and things won't end well for you.
[The arms retreat off of Luz.]
Emperor Belos: Now I'm just a humble messenger for the Titan. In the grand scheme of things, the Owl Lady's life is inconsequential. [steps directly in front of Luz] But then you showed up. If you want to save your mentor, give me the portal to the human realm.
Luz: But... my home.
[Luz looks up. Cut to the petrification machine, which is completely powered on. A bolt of green energy directs itself to the cage.]
Beast Eda, King, and Lilith: [scream]
[Beast Eda dives in front of Lilith and King, taking the full brunt of the blast of magic.]
Lilith: Edalyn!
Beast Eda: [screams, more beast than Eda]
[Cut back to Belos and Luz.]
Emperor Belos: You probably think we want to invade the human realm, but the Titan's will is not so boarish. You'll understand soon. Tick tock, human. The Owl Lady doesn't have much time left.
Beast Eda: [distantly screeches]
Luz: [reaches for the ceiling, for Eda] No! [grabs the clasp of her cloak as a tear runs down her cheek] Fine! [reaches under her cloak and activates the portal door, keeping the key out of sight of Belos. She hugs the door to her chest.] Lo siento, mamá. [grabs Eda's staff and stands, reluctantly walking towards Belos and holding out the door] Here, it's yours.
Emperor Belos: The Titan will be pleased.
[Belos takes the door. Luz's hand lingers on it, not dropping until a few seconds after it's completely out of her grasp. She finally steps on the platform that Lilith had brought her to, pulling the hood of the cloak up.]
Emperor Belos: Go on then. [He taps his staff against the ground, making the platform rise] Go be a hero.
Luz: I may have lost, but so have you.
[Luz turns around and taps Eda's staff against the platform. Owlbert's eyes glow, as do the fire glyphs on the door before the latter ignite, making the portal to the human realm explode. Belos backs away from the flaming eye, the only substantial part of the door that remains. He glares at Luz through the smoke, who glares right back as the platform carries her out of the chamber.]
[Cut to Beast Eda, whose legs begin turning to stone. Luz and the platform rise in between the cage and the petrification machine. Luz grabs a plant glyph and throws it to the base of the machine. Vines burst out of the glyph and rock the machine to the side, stopping it.]
Beast Eda: [screeches and falls to the ground, nearly completely stone]
King: Wh-- what do we do?!
Lilith: The spell wasn't completed! Maybe I can help her fight it! [puts her hands on Eda's wing]
Kikimora: No! What is happening?
Luz: [activates a fire glyph as she walks behind Kikimora] Free them, now!
[Kikimora shrinks in on herself and traces a spell circle. The cage disappears, and Luz runs to Eda.]
Luz: Eda! Are you okay?
[The stone recedes from Eda's body. Her eyes open.]
Beast Eda: As good as I'll ever be.
[Emperor's Coven guards, holding spears, close in on them. Luz prepares herself for a fight, but Eda flings her and King onto her back.]
Beast Eda: Let's fly.
[Lilith gets on in front of Luz and King, and Eda takes off. The Coven guards take aim with their spears, but none hit them. The crowd cheers as Eda flies away. Cut to Kikimora glaring after them, until Emperor Belos walks out, his mask still broken.]
Kikimora: My liege.
Emperor Belos: [walks to the edge of the roof] Children of the Isles. The Titan has told me to spare the Owl Lady's life, but in return, her curse will strip away all her powers. Let her monstrous form be a lesson about the dangers of wild magic.
[Cut to the Owl House, which Beast Eda lands in front of, panting heavily. Luz, Lilith, and King dismount.]
Luz: Don't worry, Eda. I'll run and get you some elixir and--
Lilith: No, human. No amount of elixir can heal her now. Oh, sister. [cups Eda's face] I should have done this a long time ago. [puts their foreheads together] With this spell declared, let the pain be shared.
[Lilith and Beast Eda glow blue and float. Their gems glow, and Eda returns back to her usual witch form. Luz shields King from the light, and they both turn when it fades to see Eda, back to normal, and Lilith land softly.]
Luz: Eda!
[Lilith and Eda turn their heads to reveal that one of each of their eyes has turned gray, and Lilith now has a streak of gray hair while Eda has a streak of white and her gem is still black. Eda laughs as Luz and King run and hug her.]
Luz: Can you still do magic?
Eda: [traces a spell circle, which disintegrates] That's a no. It'll take some time to get used to this.
Lilith: I feel that I've been weakened as well.
Luz: It's okay. I can teach you what I know, and what we don't know, we can learn together.
[Luz puts a light glyph in Eda's hand. Eda activates it, looking shocked that it worked. The ball of light floats into the night sky. Lilith walks closer to the others.]
Eda: [ruffling Luz's hair] Thanks, kid. [pulls Luz into a hug] I look forward to that.
[Camera focuses on the ball of light, which rises until it gets lost among the stars.]
Luz: [voiceover] And that's how we escaped from the Emperor.
[Cut to Luz's room, where she's laying on her stomach in her sleeping bag. King is asleep at her feet.]
Luz: Everyone told me he was the most powerful witch alive.
[Cut to the view of Luz's phone, where she's recording a video.]
Luz: But look at this, Mom. [holds up the chip of Belos's mask] I chipped off a piece of his mask! I know he's not invincible now. [her expression falls] It's a strange feeling, having gone through so much and, not having you here to share it with. And I don't know when or how I'm gonna see you again. [puts her phone down and looks at a picture of her and Camila, then at the ball of light hovering in front of her] But I will find my way home to you. I promise. Deja una luz puesta para mí. Te quiero.
[Luz pokes the ball of light, putting it out. Several balls of light hovering outside of her window float away when it goes dark. Cut to a staircase in the Emperor's Castle, which Belos is standing in front of and Kikimora is walking down.]
Kikimora: Sire, those miscreants are still at large. Please, allow me to capture them.
Emperor Belos: Worry not, Kiki. We'll be keeping an eye on the inhabitants of the Owl House.
[Belos nods to a robed figure wearing a mask that resembles an owl. They nod back before walking away.]
Emperor Belos: In the meantime, the Day of Unity is almost upon us...
[Belos turns, and the camera moves to reveal a round white frame with wings attached to it, partially built. Inside the frame is the portal door, still broken, but being pieced back together.]
Emperor Belos: ...and we have much work to do.
