[Open on the back of the Owl House. Cut to the kitchen where Eda is stirring something on the stove while King is watching Luz talk to Willow and Gus on a crystal ball.]
Luz: So they said I couldn't remove my thumb, but look at that! [pretends to remove her thumb] Whoop!
Gus: You sliced it off! [panicked] You sliced off your own thumb!
Willow: [chuckles] You make doing homework actually fun.
Luz: And they say humans can't do magic.
King: Luz... [climbs onto table] Nyeh! You've been talking to them all morning. Don't forget about the Luz and King comedy hour!
Eda: Please, no. Not the comedy hour...
King: This week I've been working with props! [turns around to show a cardboard tube on his nose] Oh dear, I've gotten a tube stuck on my nose! Will I ever eat again? [slams a piece of bread on his face] Looks like I'm toast!
Luz and King: [laugh]
Eda: It just goes on like this for an hour!
Luz: Heyo, dough boy, quit loafing around!
King: Why don't you bake me?
Luz and King: [laugh]
[The crystal ball buzzes with an alarm and flashes red. The time, 8:00, flashes below Willow and Gus.]
Luz: School time! See you guys in class!
Willow: Bye!
Gus: But what about the thumb?!
[Luz ends the call.]
King: [sigh]
Luz: Hey, don't worry. We'll finish our comedy hour when I get home. [kisses King's skull and heads for the door]
King: Hee hee, oh you!
Luz: [singsong] Try not to miss me while I'm gone! [closes door]
King: [scrambles over to the door] You... you really think she's coming back this time?
Eda: Yes, she'll be back; she always comes back. It's cute you miss her, though.
King: The King of Demons-- [tosses bread and tube off] The King of Demons misses nobody! I wouldn't care if she came through this door right now! Wha!
[Luz comes through the door.]
Eda: Hey, you're-
King: You're back! [climbs up on Luz's head] I didn't miss you at all.
Luz: Apparently there's an infestation of pixies at Hexside, so school's been canceled.
King: That sounds like a crumby situation.
Luz and King: [laugh]
Hooty: Hey! Guess what's been in my mouth that I'm about to throw up!
[Hooty gags for several long moments. Everyone stares at him in disgust. He finally throws up letters and a box.]
Hooty: The mail!
Eda: [going through the letters] Junk, junk, death hex.
[She tosses the death hex letter into a trashcan, which condenses into a dark purple ball before disappearing entirely.]
Eda: Oh, a carnival's in town today!
Luz: A carnival? [takes King off her head] You know, I've been so busy with school lately, what do you say we take this comedy hour on tour? It'll be a Luz and King day!
King: That's my kinda day!
Luz: [puts an arm around Eda] Let's all three of us go!
Hooty: An adventure with friends! I'll go pack my stuff!
Eda: Carnivals bring crowds and crowds bring suckers. This could be the perfect chance to try out my new get-witch-quick scheme. [takes staff out of pot, knocks goop off of Owlbert] I'm in! To the carnival!
Luz and King: To the carnival!
[They all leave.]
Hooty: Good news, I'm bringing my knapsack full of games! Hello?
[A fly buzzes near him.]
Hooty: Oh, a fly! Talk to me, talk to me!
-THEME SONG-
[Cut to the Bonesborough Carnival.]
Eda: Well, here we are, kids. Look at all that fresh meat.
[Flies buzz around a fried chicken on a stick.]
Luz: [now in her usual attire] And smell all the fresh meat! [sniffs as a fly goes up her nose; coughs it out her mouth] Fun!
Owlbert: [hoots, starts to twist off the staff]
Eda: No games for you, Owlbert, we've got scams to run.
Owlbert: [sad hooting]
Tibbles: Friends! [lands in front of them] Welcome!
[Everyone jumps into defensive poses.]
Tibbles: I see you got my postcard.
Eda: Tibbles? You sent this?
[Eda looks on the back of the flier. It reads: "To my Owl House Pals, From Tibbles," and has a picture of Tibbles dancing when Eda tilts it. She lowers it and Tibbles is doing the same dance.]
Tibbles: Mm-hmm.
Luz: Aren't you mad at us for destroying your stand?
King: Ooh, and destroying his life! That was the best part!
Tibbles: No, no, no. I should thank you. After my stand was destroyed, I reevaluated my life and found my true calling! I'm now ringmaster of... [snaps whip] Tibbles's Tent of Tiny Terrors!
[Luz approaches the terrarium containing tiny unicorns, a tiny manticore, and a tiny griffin.]
Luz: Aww. It's like a regular circus but adorably small!
Griffin: [hisses]
Luz: [presses her face to the glass] You're my friends now.
Eda: I don't buy it. [sends away her staff] What kind of con are you running?
Tibbles: No cons here, Owl Lady, only pros. In fact, why don't we toast our newfound friendship with this totally innocent bottle of water. [pulls out potion]
Eda: [takes potion; sarcastically] Oh yeah, sure! Why don't I just--
[Eda throws the bottle. It lands on an Oracle Teacher's head and knocks them on their back.]
Oracle Teacher: I'm okay!
Eda: I know poison when I see it; you can't scam a scammer! Now speaking of scams... [walks up to a stand] Beat it loser! [knocks the vendor's stuff to the ground] Step right up to... [transforms the stand] Eda's Human Horror House! Humans shed their skin and I've got proof. [pulls out fishnet stockings]
King: You should really put a lock on your closet.
Luz: You know what, Eda can pick through my socks all she wants. Because today is all about having a great time with my partner in crime.
King: That's me! I love crime!
Luz and King: [laugh, walk off]
Tibbles: Have a good time, friends. [whisper] While it lasts.
[Cut to a dunk tank.]
Abomination Student: Dunk the skeleton! Win a prize!
[A ball hits the target, dumping the skeleton into a cauldron labelled SKIN. The skeleton pops out now covered in skin.]
Skeleton: Ah! Aah! I'm covered in pores!
Luz: Now this is my kind of weird! So what do you wanna do first? We could brave the molar coaster, or eat a mysterious blob...
King: Ooh, what's that? [runs up to prize booth] Ah! Some kind of deadly string weapon.
Luz: No, silly. That's a friendship bracelet.
King: Is that a type of deadly weapon?
Luz: A weapon of love. [grabs them and puts them together, forming a heart] It's basically a declaration to the whole world that you're the best of friends.
King: Ooh! That's way safer than becoming blood brothers! Luz, we must have those bracelets!
Prize Vendor: And yoink. [takes bracelets back] Sorry, ma'am. If your bone son wants these bracelets you'll have to play the games and win the tickets. You know, carnival rules.
King: [tugging cuff on Luz's shorts] Beat up the man and steal his things for me.
Luz: Or let's just play the games.
King: Oh, okay.
Luz and King: [laugh] Games! Games! Games! Games!
Luz: [gasps] Friends!
Willow: Luz!
Gus: Hey, Luz!
[They all hug.]
Luz: Oh my gosh, I didn't think I'd see carniv-y'all here.
Gus: Boo.
Willow: I got an invitation from Tibbles.
Gus: We figured it's a trap since we squashed his stand with a walking house.
Willow: But who cares? This place has a Scarris wheel.
Gus: It's like a human Ferris wheel but it gives you long-lasting nightmares.
Luz: Yes! This mama is ready for trauma.
King: Ahem.
Luz: Oh, yeah. We're on a very important quest to win a special prize for King.
Willow: Oh! We can help with that.
Gus: Aw. Does the little guy wanna win a prize? Uh, does he? Uh, does he? [cooing, waves his finger at King]
King: Nyeh! [knocks Gus's finger away]
Luz: What do you think, King? The more the merrier, huh?
King: Um, sure. Whatever you want, Luz.
Luz: All right. Approval!
Willow, Luz, and Gus: [cheering]
[The three of them jog away. King tries to keep up and trips. Montage: Willow rolls a skee-ball into the machine's mouth. Luz and Gus cheer her on and the three of them run off. King arrives and gets hit with the ball when the machine spits it at him; the four of them are walking when they notice a picture board. They all stick their heads through the holes, but King is stuck with being the trashcan; Luz takes a bite out of a fried orb and hands it to Willow. She takes a small bite out of it and hands it to Gus. He eats the rest of it, leaving none for King, who had been between Willow and Gus; Luz, Willow, and Gus are leaning against a stand.]
Willow: So the pixie infestation was actually caused when Boscha's pet pixie escaped its cage...
Luz: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
[King jumps and grunts, trying to actually play the booth. He finally latches onto the edge of the booth but falls back.]
King: [screams, grunts] Curse these stubby legs!
Gus, Willow, and Luz: [laugh]
[King walks away. Fade to King sitting on the stoop of a narrow booth next to a poster that reads "CARNIVAL best with friends," with a drawing of three witches on it.]
King: [looks at poster, sighs]
Tibbles: [in disguise] Oh, my, my, my. You seem troubled.
King: Weh? Who said that?
Tibbles: It is I. Obvioso, the all-seeing psychic.
King: Haven't I seen you somewhere? It's almost so...
Tibbles: Obvious?
King: That's what I was gonna say. Wow! You really are psychic.
Tibbles: You're right. And Obvioso can see that something is bothering you, little friend.
King: [sighs] You got my number, Obvioso. Today was supposed to be about me and Luz, see? But now she's distracted by her cool new school friends.
Tibbles: What if I were to tell you that there was a way to make all those problems... disappear?
King: I'd say that sounds illegal. I would also say go on.
Tibbles: [ducks into booth and laughs; grabs potion bottle with spray nozzle] Behold!
[Tibbles sprays a nearby creature on a perch with the potion. It disappears in a flash of pink light.]
King: Holy bones! You poofed it. Call the cops! This guy's crazy!
Tibbles: [chuckles] Hey. The spray is only temporary. I just give my cheeks a tap and then...
[Tibbles taps his cheeks twice. The creature reappears, visibly terrified.]
Tibbles: ...it returns safe and sound.
[The creature squawks and lays an egg. The egg cracks and a baby creature chirps.]
Tibbles: Take this. [hands King the bottle] Enjoy the carnival without the problems. Luz, Willow, and Gus will be none the wiser.
King: Whoa! You even know their names. Guess there's no use arguing with a fortune-teller. Thanks, Obvioso. [walks away]
Tibbles: [laughs, takes off fake mustache]
King: Hey.
[King returns. Tibbles holds the mustache back up.]
King: Sidenote: in the future, do I ever find love?
Tibbles: Uh... yes?
King: [laughs, leaves again]
Tibbles: [sighs]
[Cut to King walking, looking at the bottle in his hands.]
King: Hmm, maybe I should think about this first.
Luz: King!
[King shoves the bottle in his fanny pack.]
Luz: Sorry we lost you back there, little dude.
King: Hey, it's okay. [grabs Luz's hand] Let's go back to the games and win those bracelets.
Gus: [grabs Luz's other hand] But we haven't gone on any rides and there's no line for the bumper carcasses.
King: Games!
Gus: Carcasses!
King: Games!
Gus: Carcasses!
[Luz's stomach growls loudly. They all look at it.]
Luz: Food! I'm gonna crab some rotten candy while you guys figure this out. [runs] Bye!
Willow: [to Gus] When Luz comes back let's go on the three-man cauldron spinner.
Gus: Or the triple swing.
Willow: Oh, and that's close to those photo booths that can fit exactly three people.
King: But today was me and Luz's day.
Gus: Aw. Does the little baby boo miss his buddy Luz? [picks King up]
Willow: [chuckles]
Gus: Uh, does he? Uh, does he?
King: [grunts] The King of Demons misses nobody.
Gus: [laughs]
King: I demand you put me down!
[The potion falls out of King's pouch. It lands on the ground and sprays Willow and Gus.]
Willow and Gus: What?
[Willow and Gus disappear.]
King: Oh, no! What have I done?
Luz: Wow. I guess they really wanted to ride those bumper carcasses.
King: Actually, Luz. There's something I gotta tell you.
Luz: No. There's something I gotta tell you, King. [pauses] I said I'd help you win those friendship bracelets. So win them we shall, okay?
King: Uh... [whisper] Willow and Gus will be okay for a little while, right?
Luz: What was that?
King: Nothing. Now let's go! [chuckles]
Luz: Ready or not, here we crumb.
King: Yes! Ha ha!
[Camera pans down to Willow and Gus, who have actually shrunk and not disappeared.]
Gus: First, I'm growing out of my clothes. Now I'm shrinking? Dang, puberty. You're the craziest coaster of 'em all.
Willow: Ugh.
Gus: [screams] What happened to us? Did I black out on the molar coaster again?
Willow: Sketchy carnival rides are not to blame this time. King had something in his pouch that made us small.
Gus: And I just got tall enough for the rides! [sobs]
[A shadow falls over them.]
Willow: Gus...
[The creature that Tibbles sprayed before is now standing in front of them.]
Creature: [roars]
Gus: Ah!
[Willow grabs Gus' hand and runs to a styrofoam cup. Willow moves it so they're standing under it.]
Gus: I think we're safe now.
[A tongue pierces the cup three times.]
Willow and Gus: [scream]
Gus: Ew! [hugs Willow]
Willow: Enough of this!
[Willow's eyes glow green. Vines sprout from the ground and grab onto the creature's tongue, trapping it on the cup. Willow and Gus run to a dropped rotten candy.]
Willow: Quick! We have to find Luz and get her attention before any more carnival animals hunt us down.
[Willow grabs some rotten candy and whistles. A fly lands and eats the rotten candy.]
Willow: Eat up, my stead. Lead us to safety. [climbs onto the fly]
Gus: It's so hairy. Why is it so hairy?
Willow: Because up close, everything is hairy. [grabs Gus and flies away]
Gus: [yelps]
[Cut to Eda's stand.]
Eda: Round as the moon, her ears are, with mood swings as terrifying as night itself. Now, [holds up a fidget spinner] who wants to touch an outdated human reference? [spins it]
[The people at her stand pull out snails.]
Citizen #1: I do.
Citizen #2: Me.
Clown Guard: Okay, show's over. This witch doesn't have a license.
Citizen #2: I can't do time again!
Citizen #1: Run!
Eda: Ah, what are you? The fun police?
Clown Guard: Yes! [squeaks badge that reads "Fun Police" And you're coming with me. [hits squeaky night stick against palm]
Eda: Uh, excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with your staff. [points empty staff at the guard; looks at the interlock] Owlbert! Owlbert! Where are you?
[Cut to Owlbert hooting happily and playing Whack-A-Giraffe.]
Eda: Owlbert, you're lucky I can't be mad at your adorable antics.
[Eda climbs over her stand and runs. Something clatters loudly. She has fallen into a rotten candy machine.]
Candy Vendor: Hey, I caught her.
[The clown guard walks over, shoes squeaking, and magically ties Eda up and pulls her out of the machine. Her hair is now covered in rotten candy.]
Eda: I hate carnivals.
[Cut to King leading Luz through the carnival. They stop at the prize booth. The friendship bracelets are still there. King drags Luz onward. Willow and Gus, on the fly, fly up from behind the friendship bracelet frame and follow them. Cut to Luz and King failing at skee-ball. Luz tickles the machines, which lets King successfully throw the ball in. Tickets spew out of the machine/monster as the two cheer. Cut to Gus poking the hairy back of the fly and recoiling in disgust. Willow directs the fly to Luz and King, but they move. The fly lands in the rotten candy machine. Cut to Luz and King at ring toss. One of the bottles hops out of the way of Luz's ring. The attendant shrugs. King shoves a ring over the attendant's body. The attendant reluctantly hands them tickets. Cut to Willow and Gus climbing onto a stand, covered in rotten candy.]
Willow: [panting]
Gus: We can't keep doing this.
Willow: [gasps]
[Camera pans to show a house of mirrors.]
Willow: We won't have to for much longer.
[Cut to Eda tied up sitting under a banner that reads "THE FUN POLICE because crime is no laughing matter."]
Eda: Just when I thought I couldn't respect the law any less...
[Shoes squeak as they're put on the desk.]
Eda: ...it surprises me.
Carnival Boss: So, I hear you're running scams at my carnival? That's my job. And I take my job very seriously. [his bow tie spins]
Eda: Spare me the yuks. What do you want?
Carnival Boss: Since I'm a forgiving demon, I'll give you two options. [gestures to Eda's wanted poster] I can pass you along to the Emperor's Coven, who'll throw you in the Conformatorium, or you can scam for me.
[He points to a dress on a mannequin and a cart of caramel crab apples.]
[Cut to the prize booth, where the vendor is counting Luz and King's tickets.]
Prize Vendor: 1230... 1231...
King: [squeals]
Luz: Now, King, before you spend your tickets are you sure you want those friendship bracelets and not this bad boy?
[Luz points to a cursed skull, whose eye glows.]
Cursed Skull: [roars] I am the King of Night. And every breath you take brings you closer to darkness.
[Pause.]
Luz: This guy's a riot.
King: Yes, Luz. I want the bracelets. It's kind of important to me, okay?
Cursed Skull: I can be important to you. I, who have seen the birth and death of countless nations--
Prize Vendor: [smacks the skull with a broom] Hey, stop it.
Cursed Skull: [whinnies]
Prize Vendor: No, no. Stop it. Yes, where was I, uh... Well, lost count. Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six...
[The fly drops rotten candy in Luz's hair. She feels it.]
Luz: Ugh, gross. I'm gonna need a mirror. I'll be right back, King. [leaves]
Prize Vendor: 12, 13, 14...
King: Count faster.
[Cut to outside the house of mirrors, which is being pointed to by several arrows on the ground made of rotten candy.]
Luz: Oh. There we go.
[Luz follows the arrows and enters. There are more arrows inside, leading past a wall of mirrors that alter Luz's character design in every one. She reaches the end of the arrows.]
Luz: "You made it". Aw. What a supportive sign. Wait a sec.
[Willow and Gus are reflected in a mirror.]
Luz: Supportive friends!
Willow: Wait, Luz, don't do it!
[Luz runs into the mirror and slides to the ground.]
Luz: Huh?
[Willow's reflection points down. Willow and Gus step forward.]
Luz: Oh, my gosh.
[Cut to the prize stand.]
Prize Vendor: One million. Yep, I just counted to one million. The bracelets are yours. [hands them to King]
King: Yes. Yes! Now Luz and I will share a bond as mighty as these trinkets! [laughs]
[Cut to the house of mirrors as King rounds a corner.]
King: Heya, Luz. Good news. I got the bracelets.
Luz: King...
King: Huh?
[Luz holds out her hand, on which are Willow and Gus.]
King: [yelps]
Willow: You splashed us with something to make us small.
Gus: And now I can't go on the big boy rides! You monster.
King: Y-you weren't supposed to shrink. You, you were supposed to disappear. Ooh, no. Wait.
Luz: What?
King: No, no, no. Luz, I can explain. I wanted to win the bracelets and there was this psychic, see? [holds out bottle]
Luz: [puts Willow and Gus down] That must've been what did it. Give me the spray bottle, King.
King: No, wait I-I-I gotta explain.
Luz: There's nothing to explain. [tries to take the bottle]
King: I was just trying to...
Luz: Shrink my friends?
King: I was just trying to solve my problems.
[The bottle slips out of their hands. The spray nozzles loosens, resulting in both Luz and King getting splashed with the potion.]
Luz and King: Uh-oh.
[Luz and King shrink. Willow and Gus walk up to them.]
Willow and Gus: Hi.
King: Wait, I can fix it. Obvioso showed me how. Behold. [taps cheeks several times] Why isn't this working?
Tibbles: I'd say it's working quite well.
[Cut to Tibbles approaching his Tent of Tiny Terrors while holding Luz, Willow, Gus, and King. King is still tapping his cheeks.]
Gus: Um, Luz, I think King is broken.
King: Tapping my cheeks is supposed to turn us normal. The psychic told me.
Tibbles: Oh, did he? But, what if he... lied to you from the start? [summons puff of smoke, is now wearing mustache and patting out "Obvioso's" hat] Hold on. [puts hat on] Lied to you from the start? It's different.
King: You fiend. When Obvioso finds out you stole his mustache... Oh...
Gus: [facepalms]
Tibbles: The potion was designed by me. Guess whose cheeks control it?
Luz: Why are you doing this?
Tibbles: [rips off mustache] When you destroyed my stand, you destroyed generations of Grimm Hammer history. Now it's time to pay.
[Cut to the inside of the tiny terrors' cage. which they are dropped into.]
All: [scream] Oof!
Tibbles: Welcome to the greatest show on the Boiling Isles!
Crowd: [cheers]
All: [gasp]
Tibbles: Will these witches and demon survive feeding time? Let's find out!
[Tibbles rings a bell. The tiny terrors growl as they exit their tent. One unicorn still looks friendly.]
Luz: Aw. At least he's still my friend.
[Angry neighing.]
Luz: That's how friends react.
Tiny Terrors: [growling, advancing]
Tibbles: You ruined my livelihood. So now, you'll feed my livelihood.
[With a twirl of his finger, a spotlight turns on. Curtains open to show the inside of the cage is magnified for the crowd's viewing pleasure. Luz, Willow, Gus, and King are backed into a corner by the manticore and a unicorn.]
Tibbles: Place your bets and enjoy the show!
Gus: Well, if I have to go, at least I'm with my best friends. And King.
[The unicorn whinnies and pounces at them. They all run. The unicorn growls.]
Eda: Caramel Crab Apples. Get 'em hot and pinchy.
Man: Hey, over here!
Eda: Yeah, yeah. [winces] Hold your spider-horses.
[Gus creates an illusion of a vacuum, causing the animals to cower. Willow summons vines to tip over a water holder. The manticore steps through the illusion vacuum. The four take cover behind the water holder seconds before the manticore runs into it.]
Luz: We've gotta--
[Bang.]
Luz: --find a way out of here!
[Another bang. King looks around. Unicorns bite at both ends of the water holder, making Willow and Gus flinch. Luz ducks under the manticore's claws.]
King: Ah, King, you idiot. This is all your fault. [pulls out friendship bracelets] But I think I know how to fix it.
[King runs out from cover. A unicorn watches him and chases him.]
Luz: King?
King: Willow, Gus, I'm sorry for poofing you. And Luz, I'm sorry for taking away your friends.
[A unicorn and the manticore advance on King, growling.]
King: I know you'll eventually go home and now you're spending more time at school. I just... wanna be around you!
[Luz looks surprised as King jumps and dodges all the animals and climbs to the rim of the cage.]
Student #1: No!
Student #2: Boo! Boo!
[Crowd booing.]
Tibbles: [from atop his pile of snails] No refunds.
Tiny Terrors: [whimpering]
King: Alright. I only have one shot. [throws friendship bracelets] Nyah!
[The bracelets land on Tibbles's cheek.]
Tibbles: Darn flies. [taps cheek] Oh, no.
[King, Luz, Willow, and Gus all begin to glow. Cut to Eda.]
Crowd: [booing]
Eda: Hey, hey. No discounts, buddy.
Man: You guys owe me. There's nothing happening in this show.
Man #2: Not a single one of those dumb kids have gotten hurt yet.
Eda: Dumb kids? [turns and sees the screen] Wait. Those are my dumb kids!
[Luz, Gus, Willow, and King grow back to normal size.]
All: [share look, sigh]
[Behind them, the animals also grow to full size.]
Luz: You shrunk the animals too?
Tibbles: It's the Tent of Tiny Terrors. Something needed to be tiny.
Crowd: [booing]
Man: Finish the job! Get them kids.
Student #3: Feast!
[The student throws a crab apple at the buff unicorn, which catches and eats it. The unicorn looks happy. All animals turn to the crowd, growling. Two audience members share a look. The buff unicorn whinnies and raises a hoof. The animals charge forward. The crowd screams and flees.]
Tibbles: They foiled my plans. You will pay for this! [pulls out another bottle] This time I'm gonna personally squash you!
Eda: [takes bottle] Oh, no, Tibbles. That's not how entertainment works. [tosses bottle] The bad guy always gets his just desserts. [dumps the crab apples on him]
Tibbles: Oh, no! Not desserts!
Eda: [to the animals] Hey, girls. This one's on the house.
[The unicorns chase Tibbles out.]
Willow: Looks like we ruined his life for a second time.
Gus: We're on a roll.
King: Gus, Willow, you're okay!
Luz: All thanks to you, King. [kneels down] Here. [hands him four cracked pieces of the bracelets] It was all that was left.
King: [takes them] It's... it's okay. Because now there's a piece for everybody. [holds two out to Willow and Gus] If you'll accept it, that is?
Willow: Thank you, King.
Gus: Yeah. I've always wanted to own a jagged piece of cheap metal.
Luz: That's very sweet.
King: I'm sorry, Luz. Demons do crazy things when they've been missing somebody.
Luz: [whisper] And can I tell you a secret? I've been missing you too. [kisses]
King: [giggles] Hey, we still have a few hours of carnival left. Wanna hit those bumper carcasses?
Luz: You bread my mind.
King: [laughs] Yes! Bread puns. Bread puns forever.
Luz: You coming, Eda?
Eda: [laying on Tibbles's pile of snails] Nah. I think I got everything I wanted.
[The stands collapse behind Eda.]
Eda: Yep. Another great year at the carnival.
[Cut to the Owl House, where Hooty is talking to the fly.]
Hooty: Boy, fly, we sure get into some wacky hijinks, don't we?
[The door opens, King, Eda, and Luz peek in.]
Hooty: Sure feel sorry for anyone that missed seeing us two rabble-rousers getting into scrapes.
[Luz, Eda, and King all duck back out, closing the door.]
Hooty: Good thing I brought a camera. Yep. Hooty and fly. Together forever. You and me. Every single day-- [coughs as the fly enters his mouth] Now I know what friendship taste like. Yum. Taste like a bug.
