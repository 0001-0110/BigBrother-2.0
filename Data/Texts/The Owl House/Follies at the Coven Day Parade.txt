[Scene opens with Luz recording herself using her phone.]

Luz: ¡Hola, Mamá! I know you don’t want me staying in the Demon Realm, but I’m recording this because I think we can find a middle ground. This is a world of magic and beauty. [points outside] Just look!

[Outside the Owl House, a skinless, skeletal Hooty is hanging out his skin to dry. The camera zooms in on his face. Hooty growls at the camera, while Luz screams and stops recording. Cut to Luz recording herself outside in Bonesborough.]

Luz: Well you should know, I’m even learning magic! [she activates a light glyph] And as a human, it impresses pretty much everyone.

[Boscha walks up from behind Luz and bumps into her. She accidentally stares into the light ball. She screams and covers her eyes.]

Boscha: [angrily] Human! If you ever do that again I will set your eyes on fire!

[Boscha forms a fire spell, causing Luz to cry out and stumble backwards. Cut to Luz recording herself inside Hexside.]

Luz: [chuckles nervously] Sure, the Demon Realm can be a little… [winces] But there’s no safer place than Hexside School of Magic and Demonics, right Principal Bump?

Principal Bump: Hmm? [clears throat] Why yes. The well-being of our students is our top priority. Which is why we send all out troublemakers to our new and improved detention pit.

[Camera pans to the entrance to the Detention pit. A Hexside guard is dragging a student into the pit.]

Bird student: Aah! Please, nooo!!!

[The door opens up, and the guard the throws the student inside.]

Bird student: Help me.

Luz: …That’s enough of that. [she covers the lens with her hand]

[OPENING THEME]

[Outside the school building, Luz, Gus and Willow are sitting on the staircase.]

Gus: You know, I think he does it cause he’s shy. He’s just evil and shy. It happens.

Willow: I heard there’s just a mirror underneath. [whispers] The real emperor was society all along.

Gus: Maybe he’s so handsome people have a hard time focusing on what he says. I get it… I can relate. Luz! You’ve seen Belos up close. What’s he like under… all that?

Luz: Oh. I never got a good look.

[Amity suddenly appears beside Luz.]

Amity: I heard he’s scarred from wild magic.

[Luz cries out in surprise and falls to the side.]

Luz: [sighs] Amity!

Amity: Hola, batata.

Luz: Did you just call me a sweet potato?

Amity: Yes! Is that… not a term of endearment? I’m still figuring out this human language book from Gus.

[Amity shows Luz a cookbook titled “Mamá Pura’s Recipes”. Gus gives Amity 2 thumbs up and nods.]

Luz: Aw! Amity, you’re the sweet potato!

[Luz and Amity both blush.]

Amity: Uh, so… Did that Titan Blood ever come in handy?

Willow: Did you finish building the door?

Gus: Did you visit your mom? [teasingly] Does she know about high-fives too?

Luz: Oh, uh…

[Scene cuts to flashback from “Yesterday’s Lie”, the moment when Luz is being pulled backwards and Camila tries to hold on to her.]

Camila: [tearily] Promise me. When you come home, you’ll stay with me, and you’ll never go back to that place.

Luz: [tearily] Mom, it’s not you. It never was!

Camila: Please!

Luz: [dejected] Okay, mom. I promise.

[Scene cuts back to current day.]

Luz: Uh… [chuckles nervously] Haven’t used the door yet. Waiting for a good moment, you know?

[Owlbert hoots. Luz looks up just in time to see Eda and King flying towards her on the Owl Staff.]

Luz: Later taters!

[Luz turns around to kiss Amity on the cheek, causing her to blush. Luz then rides off together with Eda and King.]

Amity: [sighs gladly] Hmm?

[Amity notices the phone Luz had left behind on the staircase. Luz's video is displayed on the screen.]

[Luz, Eda and King fly towards Bonesborough on the Owl Staff.]

King: Come on, Luz. There’s no way your mom will make you leave the Demon Realm!

Eda: Yeah! When she meets us, I’ll make sure to put on the charm… that turns people into obedient zombies.

[The trio land at the market place in Bonesborough, and Luz notices a lot of Coven Scouts around.]

Luz: Woah, what’s going on?

King: They’re probably prepping for the annual Coven Day Parade. Floats, streamers, fireworks–

Eda: [angrily] Ah, it’s just a fancy way to kiss the Emperor’s…

[Eda almost blurts out a bad word. She looks at Luz, who squints at her judgingly while covering King’s ears.]

Eda: ...Whatever. I’m just here to pick something up.

[Eda walks off, with King following. Luz stops, spotting Kikimora, who is speaking into a crow phone]

Kikimora: Mother, please! No, I’m not seeing anyone. Yes, I’m standing up straight. Listen, I can’t come home. If I don’t lead this parade, Belos will end my– No! No, of course I miss everybody. I… What? I can’t chose! Hello? Mother? Mother?

[Luz runs off to join Eda and King. They are in front of a stand called “Private Inspectergator”]

King: Hey, Luz! I know what’ll cheer you up.

Luz: Aw, no bread puns today, buddy.

King: What? No. I’m talkin’ about hot goss, girl!

[The stand owner hands over a file to Eda.]

King: Hot goss buns. Bread pun. Guess why we’re here!

Eda: [irritated] King?

King: Eda hired someone to spy on her ex!

Eda: [gasps] Did you read my diary?!

King: And they’re Head Witch of the Bard Coven!

Eda: [covers her ears] Stop it! Stop it, stop it!

King: And they also–

Eda: Yes! They secretly led a rebel group against the Emperor and got captured! I was there!

King: Ooh. [sucks teeth] I didn’t read that far.

[Luz gasps, becoming starry eyed, before collapsing to the ground.]

Eda: Well, good job. You broke Luz.

King: It was the… yeast I could do. [laughs]

[The scene cuts forward. Luz is reading from the file handed to Eda.]

Luz: And then Raine battled their fellow coven heads? And sacrificed everything to save Eda? [crying] It’s just like Hecate and Azura in book 5!

[Eda grabs the folder back from Luz.]

Eda: According to this, Raine is still working with the Emperor’s Coven which doesn’t make sense. They were seen as a traitor!

Luz: Maybe you can ask them about it. Look!

[Luz points to a Coven Day Parade billboard, which has an image of Raine on it.]

Eda: If they’re here for the parade, they’ll probably be surrounded by scouts.  Oh, we’d need someone on the inside to lend us a hand.

Luz: Hmm.

[Luz sees Kikimora, who walks by before tripping over a plank of wood]

Luz: [looking towards Eda] Hmm?

Eda: [snorts] Yeah, right. As if she’d give us the time of day.

[Cut to Kikimora, teary eyed, and being consoled by Luz. Eda and King stand near]

Kikimora: And– and then she said if I don’t make it back for the family reunion, I’d be banished from Palm Stings and the family home! But I’ve failed too many missions, and if I leave my job now, I’ll be banished from my life! [sobs]

Luz: There you go. It’s gona be okay. Maybe there’s a way we can help each other out–

[Eda grabs Luz's hood and hoists her up from the ground.]

Luz: Whoa!

Eda: Are you out of your mind? Kikimora nearly turned me to stone. She attacked you back in Latissa, and she didn’t blink when your girlfriend was thrown down a pit! Oh, she is bad, and not the hot kinda bad.

Luz: But this could be your way to talk to Raine! Isn't it worth the risk?

Eda: Maybe. But what're you getting out of this?

[Luz looks toward Kikimora]

Kikimora: On the one hand, I miss my family. On the other, Belos is not a forgiving man. But I’m just a party planner at this point…

[Luz looks back to Eda]

Luz: I'm... just a sucker for romantic reunions?

Eda: This is true… Ugh, fine!

Kikimora: Fine? What’s fine? What are you cretins planning?

Luz: Worry not, Kikimora. We’re gonna help you… by kidnapping you and Raine!

All (except Luz): What?

[Cut to later, in another part of the market. Eda pulls a sheet out from a trash can. she sniffs it, groans, but takes it anyway. Cut to Luz purchasing several potions from Morton]

Luz: Thanks, Morton!

[Hooty regurgitates several coins, and the skeleton of a small animal, into Morton's hand]

Hooty: Keep the change!

[Luz walks past King and Edric]

Edric: I call it the “Ed Ricochet 11.” [Edric pulls a large firework out from his coat] That’s how many times I was sent to the Healing Coven.

King: Ooh! Wait, are these legal?

Edric: Would that make you more or less interested in buying them?

King: Hmm.

[Cut to King, chuckling with an arm's load of fireworks. He walks though the forest until he reaches Luz, Eda, and Hooty, who are working to construct a parade float.]

Luz: Nice work, everyone.

[King sets the fireworks down.]

King: Nyeh.

Luz: Let’s go over the plan one more time. King and Hooty will pilot the float during the parade. Once it gets to the halfway point, you two will set off all the glyphs, potions, and fireworks to distract people.

King: With my love of mayhem and Hooty’s desperate need for attention, this’ll be a cake walk!

Luz: When Kikimora sends off the guards to investigate, that’s when Eda and I will obscure the stage and whisk her and Raine away. [Luz's tone becomes slightly frantic] The Coven can’t banish Kiki if she’s missing! She’ll get the best of both worlds! She’ll set an example for us all!

[Eda, King, and Hooty all stare at Luz.]

Luz: [nervously chuckles] Um, I mean– Eda gets to talk to Raine. It’s romantic!

Eda: [blushing] Oh, it’s not that romantic.

Hooty: Witch, this is peak of Mount Romance.

King: Hooty, what would you know?

Hooty: I’ve been around!

[Luz riffles through her pockets.]

Luz: Huh. Must’ve left my phone at the Owl House.

[Cut to Willow, who is working out on the balcony of her room. She goes to answer a knock at her door, finding Amity there]

Willow: Amity!

Amity: Uh, hey, Willow. It’s, uh, been a wile since I came here on my own.

Willow: Yeah. I guess it has… Are you okay?

[Amity barges into the room, startling Willow.]

Amity: So, Luz has been acting super weird, and I think she’s lying about her trip to the Human Realm, and she left her phoon, uh, phun? Ugh her thingy at school, and–

[Amity drops onto Willow's bed and screams into the sheets.]

Willow: You need to slow down for me.

Amity: Luz says she hasn’t been to the Human Realm, but I just get the feeling that she’s lying. And I can find out the truth by watching this! But I’m not gonna invade her privacy like that. Would you?

Willow: Mmm… [shrugging] Mm-mmm.

Amity: [giggles] Willow.

Willow: Listen, Blight, if you want my advice, there’s something you have to do for me first… Do you still know how to braid hair?

Amity: [chuckles] Okay. But I am a little rusty.

[Amity lets Willow's hair down, and begins braiding it.]

Amity: I’m glad we can be like this again.

[Cut to Kikimora at the parade preparations.]

Kikimora: [sighs] This isn’t going to work. I can’t believe I let them talk me into this.

Raine: Who talked you into what?

[The camera zooms out to reveal Raine, standing right next to Kikimora.]

Kikimora: R-Raine? H-How long have you been there? [stammers] Shouldn’t you be practicing your, um parade wave?

Raine: [groans] You know I hate these things. Talking to people. Waving to people. People.

[They both shudder.]

Raine: But I’m just happy to do my part.

Kikimora: You seem so much more calm than before.

[Terra Snapdragon, Head Witch of the Plant Coven, suddenly appears in front of Kikimora and Raine.]

Terra: Oh, why wouldn’t they be? They were sick for a while, but thanks to me, they’re good as new!

Kikimora: T-Terra! And what brings you out of your greenhouse, Head Witch?

Raine: Terra’s been helping me recover. I can’t remember anything with these… [winces] …headaches.

Terra: Here, sprout. Drink your tea.

[Terra drops a flower into the tea in Raine's drinking horn, turning the liquid pink. Raine then takes a sip.]

Terra: There you go. Now. You’re gonna get on top of that float and wave to thousands of chumps all night. Remember to lead with your elbow.

Raine: I’m on it.

[Raine and Terra walk off together.]

Kikimora: Terra could ruin everything!

[Kikimora starts dialing on her crow phone, but is interrupted by Terra.]

Terra: You’re not trying to leave, are you? Come. The parade is about to begin.

[Cut to sundown. The parade has now started. Eda and Luz overlook the parade from a rooftop.]

Luz: It’s almost time.

Eda: Is that our float?

[The camera cuts to the float: a larger than life effigy of Emperor Belos.]

Luz: Not bad, right?

[King and Hooty operate the float from inside. They cause the effigy to wink and make finger guns. The crowd cheers in response.]

Bystander: [teary eyed] It’s a work of art!

Luz: That was the signal!

Eda: Let’s move.

Luz: Okay.

[Eda leaps down from the roof. Luz tries to follow, but struggles to get down]

Luz: [yelps] Uh… I can’t get down.

[Cut to Kikimora, checking the time on her watch. Cut again to King & Hooty, likewise counting down the seconds.]

King and Hooty: Four! Three! Two–

[Hooty and King pull a lever, launching fireworks from the float]

Raine: [gasps]

[The fireworks explode into the words "BELOS, more like BOO-LOS!" The crowd gasps.]

Raine: [groans]

Coven Scout: [To Kikimora] Should we, uh, do something about that?

Kikimora: Yes, of course, you hangnails! I command all of you to invesgtigate!

[The scouts run off. Eda and Luz set off smoke glyphs, engulfing Kikimora and Raine's float. Luz runs up to Kikimora and picks her up.]

Luz: And scoop!

Kikimora: Ooh! I cannot believe we are being taken against our will. What sayeth you, fiend?

Luz: Uh! That’s right! I, Hecate, will whisk you away to my kingdom of mirrors and snakes!

[Amity, who is in the parade crowd, is able to recognize Luz's voice. She facepalms while letting out an exasperated sigh.]

Luz: [hushed] Hey, come on. I didn’t know I had to prepare lines.

[Eda uses a plant glyph to tie Raine up in vines. She slings Raine over her shoulder.]

Eda: Knock it off, you two. Let’s get crackin’. [Eda disappears with an invisibility glyph.]

Luz: Right. [Luz likewise disappears.]

King: Mission success, Hooty! Now, how do we get outta here?

Hooty: We’re gonna have to be sneaky.

[Hooty uses his elongated body to lift the effigy of Belos.]

Hooty: Hi! It’s me! Your good buddy Belos! Worship me!

Coven Scout: Kill that monstrosity!

Hooty: [laughs] Not the first time I’ve heard that!

[Under Hooty's control, the effigy begins hopping away. Several scouts give chase.]

Hooty: Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoot! Ha!

Coven Scout: Get him!

[Eda and Raine reappear in an alley just as the scouts pass. Eda undoes the vines tying Raine.]

Eda: Raine, I’m so glad you’re okay!

Raine: Eda? What’re you doing here?

Eda: I had to make sure you were okay after that fight with Darius and Eber.

Raine: What fight?

Eda: It was just a few weeks ago. I was with you.

Raine: Eda, I spent the last month sick in bed. And we… we haven’t spoken in years.

Eda: [gasps]

Raine: Listen, I don’t know what you want with me. But I’m Head of a Coven now. And I can’t associate with wild witches anymore. So move aside.

Eda: No. I’m not leaving till I get through to you.

Raine: Fine. We can do this the hard way.

[They both make ready to fight. Cut to Luz running down an alley with Kikimora. Hooty can be heard laughing in the distance.]

Luz: Oh, my gosh, it’s working! It’s actually working!

Kikimora: We’re visible? We need to disappear again! If we’re caught, she will end us!

Luz: Who will end us?

[The ground cracks, with giant plant carrying Terra emerging from them. Luz and Kikimora hide behind a cart.]

Kikimora: Head Witch of the Plant Coven, Terra Snapdragon.

[Cut to the effigy of Belos, still being chased]

Hooty: Law is meaningless! Stealing is legal now! I am your god!

[Cut back to Luz and Kikimora]

Terra: Oh, my word. Where could Kiki have gone? Such a valued member of the coven must be found post haste! [A fly buzzes past Terra.] Have you seen her little fly? [Terra crushes the fly.] Guess not.

[Luz and Kikimora use an invisibility glyph to disappear]

Terra: What a shame that Kikimora would disappear… and right before her promotion.

Kikimora: [yelps]

Terra: All the missions she would have led, the shiny new badge, the respect. Ah, well. Guess we’ll have to fine someone else!

[Terra shoots a spiked vine towards Luz and Kikimora's position. At the last moment, the vine stops, held back by an abomination. Luz and Kikimora reappear and run off.]

Terra: Hmm. Another pest…

[Terra destroys the abomination. Cut to Luz running with Kikimora. Amity runs up to meet them.]

Luz: [gasps] Sweet potato? How did you know–

Amity: Book 5, chapter 8, Azura pretends to kidnap Hecate–

Luz: During the ice festival to save her from the wizard clan! You remembered my favorite part.

Amity: Yes, but right now I just want to keep my girlfriend from being sent to the Conformatorium… again.

[Amity uses her magic to form an abomination skateboard. The three hop on it.]

Luz: Ooh.

[Cut back to Eda and Raine, who begin fighting]

Eda: Please. Rainestorm stop it. Ah!

[Eda ducks below a magical blast from Raine]

Raine: I don’t want to hurt you, Eda. But you’re not giving me much of a choice.

Eda: Come on, Raine! I know when you’re going easy on me.

Raine: I– [groans]

[They continue fighting. Eda blocks Raine's bow with her staff.]

Eda: Did you forget this too?

[Eda pulls out a cassette player, playing a recording of them performing "Raine's Rhapsody" together.]

Raine: [grunts] Why won’t you just leave me alone?

[Raine sends out a blast which knocks Eda to the ground]

Eda: [grunts]

Raine: For old time’s sake, I’ll give you one last chance. Move… please.

[Eda shakes her head no.]

Raine: So be it.

Coven Scout 1: I think I heard something over here!

Coven Scout 2: Head Witch! Are you there?

Coven Scout 1: Surround the area!

[Eda searches for another invisibility glyph, but can't find one on her. Raine grabs one from the ground and hesitantly hands it to Eda.]

Raine: Go home. Maybe travel for a bit. Just don’t contact me again. I work for the Emperor, after all.

Coven Scout 1: Head Witch!

[Eda uses the glyph to disappear.]

Coven Scout 1: Head Witch! Are you hurt?

Raine: No, not badly. Let’s return to the parade.

[Cut to a dock at the edge of Bonesborough, which Kikimora's hand-dragon, Princess, lays at the end of. Luz, Amity, and Kikimora make their way across the dock.]

Luz: Okay, Kikimora. Princess here will get you back to your family in Palm Stings by morning. She’s a good girl, and I’m sorry to say goodbye, but Bump couldn’t keep her at his place anymore. [Luz sets Kikimora onto Princess] Isn’t it great? You’ll see everyone at the reunion, and when you return, you can brag about your daring escape! You’re walking proof that you don’t have to chose between worlds!

Kikimora: [sighs] You’ve been such a help to me, human. You really are a kind person... and an utter fool! [laughs]

Luz: Wha?

Kikimora: Palm Stings can burn for all I care! You heard Terra. They want to promote me! Me!

Amity: She could have been lying.

Kikimora: That’s a risk I’m willing to take. Maybe as a thank you I could give Belos a few gifts. A troublemaking human and– Ah. [to Amity] You’re the little firestarter from Eclipse Lake.

[Princess lunges to attack. Amity forms a fire spell while Luz sets down an ice glyph.]

Luz: Amity! Now!

[The fire and ice spells combine to form a smoke screen, allowing Luz and Amity to run further down the dock. Amity forms an abomination gauntlet, which Luz imbues with an ice glyph.]

Luz: You got em.

[Amity fires the gauntlet at Princess, causing ice to form around Kikimora and her dragon.]

Kikimora: [gasps]

[Luz and Amity keep running. But Kikimora and Princess, thawed by the Boiling Sea, block their path]

Kikimora: Yes. Thank you Luz, for all the help.

Luz: You’re welcome! I mean… Ah, dang it!

[Vines suddenly emerge from the sea, tying Princess down to the ground.]

Luz and Amity: [gasp]

Kikimora: What is this?

[The vines tie down Kikimora as well. Terra emerges from the Boiling Sea.]

Terra: Oh, Kiki, try not to get ahead of yourself. The Emperor has a great many plans, but causing a riot by hurting a couple of children is not one of them.

Kikimora: Terra! Shouldn’t you be babysitting the bard?

Terra: I wasn’t sent here to watch over Raine. I was sent here to watch over you.

[Terra causes the vines to recede from Kikimora, freeing her.]

Terra: The promotion is real. You just had to prove your dedication.

Kikimora: Did I pass?

Terra: Unfortunately, yes.

Kikimora: [squeals] So? What’s the promotion? Who’s under my command? What do I get?

Terra: You get… to live. [groans] Come Kiki, time to head back.

[The vines re-wrap around Kikimora, dragging her and Princess away.]

Terra: [to Luz] The Emperor says he’s looking forward to meeting you, human. Until then, happy Coven Day.

[Luz and Amity both let out a sigh]

Luz: Amity, Amity! Amity, you saved me. How can I make it up to you?

Amity: Maybe… you can tell me about this.

[Amity pulls out Luz's phone, with the video still displayed on the screen.]

Luz: [gasps]

Amity: Don’t worry. I haven’t watched it. But… you did finish the portal door. You did see your mom. And it looks like it didn’t go well.

Luz: I’m sorry.

Amity: I know this situation is crazy, and I’m okay taking things one day at a time. But, I can’t help if I don’t know what’s going on.

Luz: You just looked so hopeful. You were even learning Spanish. And I thought if I helped out Kikimora, maybe there’d be hope for me.

Amity: Tell me what happened.

Luz: Okay. So, I had finished the door. But it didn’t look like the normal portal. I must have missed something. We opened it and…

[Luz continues talking as she and Amity walk back toward the parade.]

[Cut back to the parade. Coven scouts hose down the now flaming effigy of Belos as King and Hooty escape into the crowd, giggling to each other. Kikimora, Raine, and Terra stand on a podium in front of a crowd. Eda, Luz, Amity, King, and Hooty watch from a rooftop.]

Kikimora: [to the crowd] Um, thank you, Bonesborough, for joining us during this year’s Coven Day Parade. This year is extra special because the Emperor himself has an announcement to make.

[A massive projection of Emperor Belos appears behind the podium.]

Belos: Thank you, everyone. Together we are perfecting the Coven System as the Titan intended. The Day of Unity will be in exactly one month, when the tile is at it’s lowest and the moon obscures the sun. At that time, we will journey to the head of the isles, and there, the worthy shall inherit a utopia free of wild magic.

[The crowd gasps]

King: Free of wild magic? How’s he supposed to do that?

Belos: There is one more thing I’d like to share with you. I’ve always hidden my face, out of fear. But because of your support, I can finally take off this mask.

Eda: [spits] So phony. He’s just trying to distract us from his crazy utopia talk! Too bad it won’t work.

[Belos removes his mask. The crowd gasps again.]

Belos: Thank you, Boiling Isles.

[The crowd cheers.]

Bystander: We love you grandpa!

[Cut to Willow and Gus, watching the parade on Willow’s scroll. They gasp, but quickly become unimpressed]

Willow and Gus: Eh.

Belos: Happy Coven Day, everyone!

[The projection of Belos explodes into fireworks. The crowd begins chanting Belos’ name.]

Amity: Is… Belos planning something? And why did he say he’s going to meet you again? Didn’t you already meet him? What else don’t I know? What’s gonna happen?

Luz: I– I’m not sure. But for now… we’ll take things one day at a time.

[The chanting of Belos’ name continues]
